It&#x2019;s time to regift like you&#x2019;ve never regifted before. You&#x2019;re a regifting machine if you follow these three steps to freedom:</p><p>1. Smile sweetly. Never look a gift horse in the mouth. Instead, look them in the eyes while saying thank you over and over. You may also find it helpful to practice these lines (for these items): &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been meaning to try that place!&#x201d; (gift card to Taco Bell),</p><p>&#x201c;How did you know I liked this shade of green?!&#x201d; (puke green sweater), and &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, it&#x2019;s perfect&#x2014;honestly, how have I even been wearing shoes all these years?!&#x201d; (shoehorn).</p><p>2. Add it to your gifts-to-give pile. When you get home, make sure to write a thank-you card promptly and then toss the gift in the closet with your motorized self-twirling spaghetti fork, Streetlamps of the World page-a-day calendar, and novelty light-up ceramic angel. Let your inventory bulk up a bit so you&#x2019;ve got good regift variety, and be sure to hide the stash from future regiftees. Post-it Notes with the name of the person who gave it to you can also help prevent the dreaded Boomerang Gift. Don&#x2019;t let it happen to you.</p><p>3. Annnnnnd . . . regift! Remember that one man&#x2019;s trash is another man&#x2019;s treasure. When you look at it this way, it feels like you&#x2019;re doing very important gift-giving charity work. You&#x2019;re a misfit present coordinator! Now, you need to be about 90 percent sure the regiftee will love the present. After all, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with gift cards to Taco Bell and light-up ceramic angels. It&#x2019;s just that one goes to your backward-cap skateboarding rascal of a little cousin and the other goes to your Grandma who loves tacos.</p><p>AWESOME!</p><p><b>Finally finding the start of this stupid roll of tape</b></p><p>You think it&#x2019;s gonna be easy.</p><p>But finally finding and finger-peeling the start of this stupid roll of tape takes two focused hawk eyes, a sharp set of witch&#x2019;s nails, and a soft and delicate touch.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re missing these you&#x2019;re outta luck.</p><p>But if you&#x2019;ve got all three you&#x2019;re</p><p>AWESOME!</p></p><h2>Day of Honey: A Memoir of Food, Love, and War</h2><p><b>A luminous portrait of life in the war-torn Middle East, <i>Day of Honey</i> combines the brilliance of <i>From Beirut to Jerusalem</i> with the pleasures of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>. </b><br><br>American Book Award Winner<br>Winner of Books for a Better Life Award (First Book)<br>James Beard Foundation Award Nominee<br>BNN Discover Awards, second place nonfiction<br> <br><b>A luminous portrait of life in the Middle East, <i>Day of Honey </i>weaves history, cuisine, and firsthand reporting into a fearless, intimate exploration of everyday survival.</b><br> <br>In the fall of 2003, Annia Ciezadlo spent her honeymoon in Baghdad. Over the next six years, while living in Baghdad and Beirut, she broke bread with Shiites and Sunnis, warlords and refugees, matriarchs and mullahs. <i>Day of Honey </i>is her memoir of the hunger for food and friendship&#x2014;a communion that feeds the soul as much as the body in times of war.<br> <br>Reporting from occupied Baghdad, Ciezadlo longs for normal married life. She finds it in Beirut, her husband&#x2019;s hometown, a city slowly recovering from years of civil war. But just as the young couple settles into a new home, the bloodshed they escaped in Iraq spreads to Lebanon and reawakens the terrible specter of sectarian violence. In lucid, fiercely intelligent prose, Ciezadlo uses food and the rituals of eating to illuminate a vibrant Middle East that most Americans never see. We get to know people like Roaa, a determined young Kurdish woman who dreams of exploring the world, only to see her life under occupation become confined to the kitchen; Abu Rifaat, a Baghdad book lover who spends his days eavesdropping in the ancient city&#x2019;s legendary cafï¿½s; Salama al-Khafaji, a soft-spoken dentist who eludes assassins to become Iraq&#x2019;s most popular female politician; and Umm Hassane, Ciezadlo&#x2019;s sardonic Lebanese mother-in-law, who teaches her to cook rare family recipes&#x2014;which are included in a mouthwatering appendix of Middle Eastern comfort food. As bombs destroy her new family&#x2019;s ancestral home and militias invade her Beirut neighborhood, Ciezadlo illuminates the human cost of war with an extraordinary ability to anchor the rhythms of daily life in a larger political and historical context. From forbidden Baghdad book clubs to the oldest recipes in the world, Ciezadlo takes us inside the Middle East at a historic moment when hope and fear collide. <i>Day of Honey </i>is a brave and compassionate portrait of civilian life during wartime&#x2014;a moving testament to the power of love and generosity to transcend the misery of war.</p><p><b>Annia Ciezadlo</b> received her&nbsp;M.A. in journalism from New York University in 2000. In late 2003, she left New York for Baghdad, where she worked for <i>The Christian Science Monitor. </i>She has also written about culture, politics, and the Middle East for <i>The New Republic, The Nation, The Washington Post,&nbsp;</i>the<i> National Journal, The Christian Science Monitor, The New York Observer, </i>and Lebanon's <i>Daily Star</i>. Annia lives somewhere between New York and Beirut, with her husband, the journalist Mohamad Bazzi.<b><b><i>Introduction</i></b><br><br><b>The Siege</b></b><br><br>HE WAS ONE of an endangered species: among the few white, native-born cab drivers left in New York. Meaty, middle-aged, face like a potato. A Donegal tweed driving cap. He pulled up beside me, drew down the window, and growled out of the corner of his mouth: &#x201c;You wanna ride?&#x201d;<br><br>We rode in silence until we reached Atlantic Avenue. &#x201c;You see this street?&#x201d; he said, waving a massive hand at the windshield. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all Arabs on this street.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right, more or less. The conquest began in the late 1800s, as the Ottoman Empire waned and the Mediterranean silk trade collapsed. Between 1899 and 1932, a little over 100,000 &#x201c;Syrians&#x201d;&#x2014;in those days, a catchall term for practically anyone from the Levant, the French name for the eastern Mediterranean&#x2014;emigrated to the New World. Many of them settled in New York. In 1933, the Arab-American newspaper <i>Syrian World</i> described Atlantic Avenue, with gently sarcastic pride, as &#x201c;<i>the principal habitat of the species Syrianica</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>By 1998, the Atlantic Avenue strip was such a symbol of Arab-American identity that 20th Century Fox re-created it for a movie called <i>The Siege</i>. In the movie, Arab terrorists carry out a series of bombings in New York City, and the government imposes martial law and rounds up all the Arabs, guilty and innocent alike, into detention camps.<br><br>&#x201c;These Arabs, yeah,&#x201d; the cabbie continued. &#x201c;They come over here, they try to act normal. Try to act like you and me. Like they&#x2019;re fitting in, ya know?&#x201d;<br><br>He barked out a laugh. &#x201c;Turns out they&#x2019;re al-Qaeda.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a relief when people said it openly. I could talk to this guy. He was an ethnic American, and he assumed I was one too. He was right: I&#x2019;m a Polish-Greek-Scotch-Irish mutt from working-class Chicago. A product of stockyards and steel mills and secretarial schools. I could see where he was coming from. I came from there myself.<br><br>But then again: the man I loved was named for Islam&#x2019;s prophet. We had been seeing each other for about five months. I had thought of him as just another ethnic American, but now it was September 13, 2001, and suddenly nobody else seemed to see it that way. On September 11, the landlady had knocked on his door just before midnight. Mrs. Scanlon was an immigrant herself, from Ireland, and no doubt with terrorism-related memories of her own. In a high and quavering voice, she asked, &#x201c;Mohamad, are you an Arab?&#x201d;<br><br>I had been thinking about <i>The Siege</i> quite a bit since then.<br><br>When 20th Century Fox started filming <i>The Siege</i> in the late 1990s, I had just moved to the heavily Polish Brooklyn neighborhood of Greenpoint. Apparently the real Atlantic Avenue didn&#x2019;t have enough brownstones to look like New York on film, so overnight, Hollywood set designers transformed Greenpoint&#x2019;s Little Warsaw into a cinematic version of the Arab street. Awnings that had once read <i>Obiady Polski</i> (Polish Dinners) now surged with Arabic script. Tanks rolled past under klieg lights. Wandering down the imitation Atlantic Avenue, it was easy to imagine that all of our carefully constructed ethnic identities were nothing but Hollywood sets, as specious a notion as <i>the species Syrianica</i>, a scaffolding you could put up or tear down in a couple of hours.<br><br>The city had papered Greenpoint&#x2019;s streetlights with flyers forbidding people to park because of <i>Martial Law</i>, the movie&#x2019;s working title; as it happened, many Greenpointers had fled Poland in the early 1980s, when it was under actual Communist martial law. Middle-aged Polish ï¿½migrï¿½s would stop and glower at the Hollywood diktats with gloomy satisfaction: <i>You see? I told you it would happen here too</i>.<br><br>Back in September 2001, red and yellow traffic lights flowed over the dark windshield. The few cars ghosting down the empty avenue ignored them. Everyone ran red lights during the days after the attacks. Stopping seemed pointless, like everything else.<br><br>&#x201c;No, man, that&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; I said finally. &#x201c;A lot of the Arabs here left their countries because they <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> al-Qaeda. A lot of them left to get away from those guys.&#x201d;<br><br>Al-Qaeda wouldn&#x2019;t have had much use for my Arab: he&#x2019;s a Shiite, at least by birth. But introducing the Sunni-Shiite divide seemed a little ambitious in this case. &#x201c;They left cause their countries were messed up,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The ones that are here are the ones that <i>wanted</i> to come to America.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked hard at me in the rearview mirror, his eyes flashing in the little strip of glass.<br><br>I sighed. &#x201c;You know, most of the Arabs here in the U.S. are actually Christians.&#x201d;<br><br>A cowardly argument. My own Arab was a Muslim, after all.<br><br>&#x201c;Shyeah!&#x201d; the cabbie spat. &#x201c;They act like they&#x2019;re Christians. They <i>pretend</i>. But they&#x2019;re really al-Qaeda.&#x201d;<br><br>Gray metal shutters hid the store windows, but memory filled in what I couldn&#x2019;t see. Here on my right was Malko Karkanni&#x2019;s shabby storefront, jammed with bins of olives and dusty coffeepots. Mr. Karkanni liked to talk; if you had time, he would pull out a stool, make you tea, and talk about the lack of human rights in Syria, the country he still missed. Ahead on the left was a restaurant named Fountain, with a real fountain inside, like an Ottoman courtyard; once, when I told the waiter where my grandmother was from, he broke into fluent Greek. And here was Sahadi&#x2019;s, the famous deli and supermarket, run by a family that has been part of New York ever since 1895, when Abraham Sahadi opened his import-export company in lower Manhattan, back when my ancestors were still plowing fields in Scotland, Galicia, and the Peloponnese.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, my boyfriend&#x2019;s an Arab,&#x201d; I said suddenly. The words tumbled out, high-pitched and breathless. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s not al-Qaeda, and I have a lot of Arab friends, and they&#x2019;re not al-Qaeda either!&#x201d;<br><br>The eyes flashed back at me again, a little more anxiously this time. Was he going to kick me out of his car? Would he call the police, the FBI, and tell them about me and my Arab boyfriend?<br><br>Or would he just shake his head and decide that I was a fool&#x2014;one of a breed of unfortunate women who marry foreign men, put them through flight school, and end up later on talk shows insisting that &#x201c;he seemed so normal&#x201d;? Like Annette Bening in <i>The Siege</i>, who falls for an educated Arab guy, a Palestinian college professor who acts normal but&#x2014;<i>you can&#x2019;t trust them</i>&#x2014;turns out to be a terrorist in the end?<br><br>He thought about it for a block or two before he spoke. His voice was casual, and unexpectedly gentle, as if we had backed up and rewound the whole conversation to the beginning.<br><br>&#x201c;You know that place Sahadi&#x2019;s?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;ever been in there? They got some <i>great</i> food in there, yeah. Hummus, falafel, you know. Boy, that stuff is pretty good. You ever try it?&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;s a saying in Arabic: <i>Fi khibz wa meleh bainetna</i>&#x2014;there is bread and salt between us. It means that once we&#x2019;ve eaten together, sharing bread and salt, the ancient symbols of hospitality, we cannot fight. It&#x2019;s a lovely idea, that you can counter conflict with cuisine. And I don&#x2019;t swallow it for a second. Just look at any civil war. Or at our own dinner tables, groaning with evidence to the contrary.<br><br>After September 11, liberal New Yorkers flocked to Arabic restaurants, Afghan, even Indian&#x2014;anything that seemed vaguely Muslim, as if to say, &#x201c;Hey, we know you&#x2019;re not the bad guys. Look, we trust you, we&#x2019;re eating your food.&#x201d; New York newspapers ran stories about foreigners and their food, most of which followed much the same formula: the warmhearted ï¿½migrï¿½ alludes mournfully to troubles in his homeland; assures the readers that not all Arabs/Afghans/Muslims are bad; and then shares his recipe for something involving eggplants. They were everywhere after September 11, photos of immigrants holding out plates of food, their eyes beseeching, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t deport me! Have some hummus!&#x201d; But a lot of them did get deported, and American soldiers got sent to Afghanistan and Iraq. A decade later, the lesson seems clear: You can eat eggplant until your toes turn purple, and it won&#x2019;t stop governments from going to war.<br><br>But then again, there is something about food. Even the most ordinary dinner tells manifold stories of history, economics, and culture. You can experience a country and a people through its food in a way that you can&#x2019;t through, say, its news broadcasts.<br><br>Food connects. In biblical times, people sealed contracts with salt, because it preserves, protects, and heals&#x2014;an idea that goes back to the ancient Assyrians, who called a friend &#x201c;a man of my salt.&#x201d; Like Persephone&#x2019;s pomegranate seeds, the alchemy of eating binds you to a place and a people. This bond is fragile; people who eat together one day can kill each other the next. All the more reason we should preserve it.<br><br>Many books narrate history as a series of wars: who won, who lost, who was to blame (usually the ones who lost). I look at history as a series of meals. War is part of our ongoing struggle to get food&#x2014;most wars are over resources, after all, even when the parties pretend otherwise.<br><br>But food is also part of a deeper conflict, one that we all carry inside us: whether to stay in one place and settle down, or whether to stay on the move. The struggle between these two tendencies, whether it takes the form of war or not, shapes the story of human civilization. And so this is a book about war, but it is also about travel and migration, and how food helps people find or re-create their homes.<br><br>One of my old journalism professors, a man with the unforgettable name of Dick Blood, used to roar that if you want to write the story, you have to eat the meal. He was talking about Thanksgiving, when reporters visit homeless shelters, collect a few quotes, and head back to the newsroom to pump out heartwarming little features without ever tasting the turkey. But I&#x2019;ve found that this command&#x2014;<i>&#x201c;You have to eat the meal&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;is a good rule for life in general. And so whenever I visit a new place, I pursue a private ritual: I never let myself leave without eating at least one local thing.<br><br>We all carry maps of the world in our heads. Mine, if you could see it, would resemble a gigantic dinner table, full of dishes from every place I&#x2019;ve been. Spanish Harlem is a <i>cubano</i>. Tucson is avocado chicken. Chicago is <i>yaprakis;</i> Beirut is <i>makdous;</i> and Baghdad&#x2014;well, Baghdad is another story.<br><br>In the fall of 2003, I spent my honeymoon in Baghdad. I&#x2019;d married the boyfriend, who was also a reporter, and his newspaper had posted him to Iraq. So I moved to Beirut, with my brand-new husband and a few suitcases, and then to Baghdad.<br><br>For the next year, we tried to act like normal newlyweds. We did our laundry, went grocery shopping, and argued about what to have for dinner like any young couple, while reporting on the war. And throughout all of it, I cooked.<br><br>Some people construct work spaces when they travel, lining up their papers with care, stacking their books on the table, taping family pictures to the mirror. When I&#x2019;m in a strange new city and feeling rootless, I cook. No matter how inhospitable the room or the streets outside, I construct a little field kitchen. In Baghdad, it was a hot plate plugged into a dubious electrical socket in the hallway outside the bathroom. I haunt the local markets and cook whatever I find: fresh green almonds, fleshy black figs, just-killed chickens with their heads still on. I cook to comprehend the place I&#x2019;ve landed in, to touch and feel and take in the raw materials of my new surroundings. I cook foods that seem familiar and foods that seem strange. I cook because eating has always been my most reliable way of understanding the world. I cook because I am always, always hungry. And I cook for that oldest of reasons: to banish loneliness, homesickness, the persistent feeling that I don&#x2019;t belong in a place. If you can conjure something of substance from the flux of your life&#x2014;if you can anchor yourself in the earth, like Antaeus, the mythical giant who grew stronger every time his feet touched the ground&#x2014;you are at home in the world, at least for that meal.<br><br>In every war zone, there is another battle, a shadow conflict that rages quietly behind the scenes. You don&#x2019;t see much of it on television or in the movies. This hidden war consists of the slow but relentless destruction of everyday civilian life: The children can&#x2019;t go to school. The pregnant woman can&#x2019;t give birth at a hospital. The farmer can&#x2019;t plow his fields. The musician can&#x2019;t play his guitar. The professor can&#x2019;t teach her class. For civilians, war becomes a relentless accumulation of <i>can&#x2019;ts</i>.<br><br>But no matter what else you can&#x2019;t do, you still have to eat. During wartime, people&#x2019;s lives begin to revolve around food: first to stay alive, but also to stay human. Food restores a sense of familiarity. It allows us to reach out to others, because cooking and eating are often communal activities. Food can cut across social barriers, spanning class and sectarian lines (though it can also, of course, reinforce them). Making and sharing food are essential to maintaining the rhythms of everyday life.<br><br>I went to the Middle East like most Americans, relatively naive about both Arab culture and American foreign policy. Over the next six years, I saw plenty of war, but I also saw normal, everyday life. I sat through ceremonial dinners with tribal sheikhs in Baghdad; kneeled and ate <i>kubbet hamudh</i> on the floor with Iraqi women from Fallujah; drank home-brewed <i>arak</i> with Christian militiamen in the mountains of Lebanon; feasted on boiled turkey with a mild-mannered <i>peshmerga</i> warlord in Kurdistan; and learned how to make <i>yakhnet kusa</i> and many other dishes from my Lebanese mother-in-law, Umm Hassane, who doesn&#x2019;t speak a word of English. Other people saw more, did more, risked more. But I ate more.<br><br>If you want to understand war, you have to understand everyday life first. The dominant narrative of the Middle East is perpetual conflict: the bombs and the bullets and the battles are always different, and yet always, somehow, depressingly the same. And so this book is not about the ever-evolving ways in which people kill or die during wars but about how they live before, during, and after those wars. It&#x2019;s about the millions of small ways people cope&#x2014;the ways they arrange their lives, under sometimes unimaginable stress and hardship, and the ways they survive.<br><br>Every society has an immune system, a silent army that tries to bring the body politic back to homeostasis. People find ways to reconstruct their daily lives from the shambles of war; like my friend Leena, who once held a dinner party in her Beirut bomb shelter, they work with what they have. This is the story of that other war, the one that takes place in the moments between bombings: the baker keeps the communal oven going so his neighborhood can have bread; the restaurateur converts his cafï¿½ into a refugee center; the farmer feeds his neighbors from his dwindling stock of preserves; the parents drive all over Baghdad trying to find an open bakery so their daughter can have a birthday cake. They are warriors just as much as those who carry guns. There are many ways to save civilization. One of the simplest is with food.<br><br>ï¿½ 2011 Annia Ciezadlo</p><h2>Truth &amp; Bright Water</h2><p>With a plethora of superb reviews and upcoming publication in the US, Thomas King&#x2019;s latest work affirms him as one of our wittiest and wisest writers. <em>Truth &amp; Bright Water</em> is the tale of two young cousins and one long summer. Tecumseh and Lum live in Truth, a small American town, and Bright Water, the reserve across the border and over the river. Family is the only reason most of the people stay in the towns, and yet old secrets and new mysteries keep pulling the more nomadic residents back to the fold.<br><br>Monroe Swimmer, famous Indian artist, returns to live in the old church with the hope of painting it into the prairie landscape and re-establishing the buffalo population.

And why is Lum interested only in winning the Indian Days race?<br><br>Tecumseh has more questions than anyone will answer, until the Indian Days festival arrives and the mysteries of the summer collide in love, betrayal and reconciliation. Equally plainspoken and poetic, comic and poignant, <em>Truth &amp; Bright Water</em> is a crackling good story that resonates with universal truths.</p><p><p><strong>THOMAS KING</strong> is an award-winning writer whose fiction includes <em>Green Grass, Running Water</em>; <em>Truth and Bright Water</em> and <em>The Back of the Turtle</em>, which won the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award.

Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorWhen the first humans came to settle the planet Pern, they did not come alone: intelligence-enhanced dolphins also crossed the stars, to colonize the oceans of the new planet while their human partners settled the vast continents. But then disaster struck in the form of Thread, deadly silver spores that fell like rain from the sky, devouring everything - and everyone - in their path. And as the human colonists&#39; dreams of a new, idyllic life shattered into a desperate struggle for survival, the dolphins were forgotten, left to make their own life in the seas of Pern. As time went by, human memory of dolphins was lost to legend, and only the occasional tall tale of &#34;shipfish&#34; rescuing fishermen lost at sea kept the legend alive. But the dolphins never forgot, and from generation to generation they preserved their oral history against the day when humans at last might remember their old friends, and once again the seas would resound with the ringing of the dolphins&#39; bells from docks and ships... Now, centuries later, the dragonriders of Pern were on the verge of ridding their planet of Thread forever. But T&#39;lion, a young bronze rider, was not old enough to participate in that great venture. Instead, he and his dragon, Gadareth, were relegated to conveying people from place to place - until he and Readis, son of the Lord Holder of Paradise River Hold, made contact with the legendary &#34;shipfish&#34;. And as the dragonriders grappled with the ending of an era, T&#39;lion, Readis, and the dolphins faced the start of a new one: reviving the bond between land- and ocean-dwellers and, in the process, resurrecting the dreams of the first colonists of Pern...</p><h2>Triumph Motorcycles: The art of the motorcycle</h2><p><br><p><b><b>This is the definitive story of Triumph, told through 130 years of its magnificent motorcycles.</b></b></p>Created <b>with support from Triumph</b> and with a foreword from CEO Nick Bloor, <i>The Art of the Motorcycle</i> is a celebration of Triumph's most beautiful bikes, and an essential companion for any fan.<br><br>Marlon Brando rides a Triumph 6T Thunderbird in <i>The Wild Ones</i>.

VIPs were abundant.<br> <br>Mikey was starstruck. While everyone in the audience tracked the mesmerizing movements of the Japanese players in their colorful robes, Mikey focused on the bigger picture. Yes, he took in the artistry of the actors, but his expert eye also cataloged the exquisite details of the backdrops, the exotic sweep of the pageantry, and how each played off the other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Her costume and makeup are perfect,&#x201d; Mikey said in a low voice. &#x201c;Is that really a man under there?&#x201d;<br> <br>My friend&#x2019;s emerald-green eyes sparkled as he soaked up the spectacle. Onstage, snowflakes wafted down. A woman in an elaborately embroidered kimono cooed plaintively for her lover. The expression of emotional turmoil on her face was sublimely complex, half-hopeful even as it plunged toward despair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Early in seventeenth-century Japan, the shogun famously banned women from the Kabuki stage. The elegantly clad females proved too much of a temptation for aristocratic samurai, who were expected to set an example for the common people by staking out society&#x2019;s moral high ground. Over time, the long-standing men-only policy evolved into a tradition that persists to this day.<br> <br>Mikey remained incredulous. &#x201c;Are you absolutely sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kabuki troupes wasted no time in seeking men with the prowess to play women. Costumes were upgraded. Makeup was subtly altered. Gestures demure and flirtatious were endlessly practiced and refined, then perfected. The Kabuki experience reached new heights. Even today, Kabuki continued to win converts. Transfixed, Mikey was clearly another. Before him, an actor in snow-white makeup, coiffed wig, and ruby lips uttered a soft lament.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d she say, Brodie?&#x201d;<br> <br>She. I told him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Brilliant,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;The mood of the lighting and even the set itself echoes her sentiment.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael C. Dillman was a production designer. He created sets for movies. Tonight he was a kid in a candy store. We&#x2019;d run into each other at San Francisco State, where we shared the same artistic sensibilities. Mikey funneled his into set design. I channeled mine into a store selling Japanese art and antiquities out on Lombard, west of Van Ness Avenue.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is it you two never met?&#x201d; I asked, a reference not to the &#x201c;temptress&#x201d; onstage but to Sayuri &#x201c;Sharon&#x201d; Tanaka.<br> <br>My old college buddy blushed. &#x201c;I . . . I just never found the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled at his transparent evasion.<br> <br>Mikey was shier than shy, even with two Oscar nominations and one win under his belt. Sharon Tanaka was a famed Japanese designer for stage and screen and had been hired to create special backdrops for the Kennedy Center production.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did I thank you for getting me in to see her, Brodie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mikey was a longtime admirer of Sharon Tanaka&#x2019;s work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. More times than I can count.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sharon and I were friends and frequented some of the same art circles in Tokyo. When Mikey had heard she would be traveling to Washington with the Kabuki troupe, he asked me to arrange a meeting.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is a dream. Thanks, man. I owe you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>From under a disheveled bush of auburn hair, his eyes glowed with a gratefulness I found embarrassing. I glanced away, recalling the first time I&#x2019;d seen the look. We were college roommates for a while, sharing a near-campus apartment. I got a dose of the look when I gave him the larger bedroom, because even back then he was hauling around cumbersome stage paraphernalia.<br> <br>Mikey checked his watch. &#x201c;Time to go see the grand lady. Thanks again, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop saying that. Maybe one day you two can collaborate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mikey grew wistful at the thought. &#x201c;That would be nice. Wish me luck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need any. Just enjoy the get-together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turned out I was wrong.<br> <br>He needed luck in the worst way&#x2014;and didn&#x2019;t get it.</p><h2>Have You Seen Bugs?</h2><p>Rhyming verse accompanies detailed paper sculptures in this stunning book which gives readers a vivid view of the lives of bugs, from their shapes to the work they do. Full color.</p><p>Eye-popping artwork headlines this sensational picture book in praise of insects. Oppenheim's (Have You Seen Birds?) sprightly verse takes an up-close-and-personal view of bugs in all their splendid variety ("Bugs with stripes/ or speckles/ or spots,/ shiny like metal/ or covered in dots"). Meanwhile, Broda's exquisite painted paper sculptures, strategically placed against a series of watercolor backdrops, give the pages depth, texture and a brilliantly surreal flavor. Readers will be craning their necks for a "how did he do that?" look at the detail, from the intricate designs of a butterfly's wing to the gleaming metallic back of a beetle. Touching upon caterpillars and crickets, ladybugs and lacewing dragonflies, author and illustrator cover a lot of ground and, thanks to Oppenheim's hardworking verse as well as the careful art, they pack in a surprising amount of information. While this finely wrought book is particularly well suited to the learning style of younger readers, those at the upper end of the target group will no doubt be equally enthralled. Ages 5-8. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5^-8. From the author of <i>Have You Seen Birds?</i> (1987) and <i>Have You See Trees?</i> (1995), this book uses verse to introduce the variety and characteristics of insects. The word <i>bug</i> is used loosely, as the book includes moths, bees, and spiders. In rhymes such as "Some are fast: / they dart and leap; / some are slow: / they crawl and creep," the text points out basic differences in the way insects look, move, sound, hear, taste, eat, work, and grow from egg to adult. The artwork, constructed of three-dimensional paper sculptures, consists of painted, molded, and sometimes embossed papers that are cut and combined into scenes of bugs in their habitats. Some of the illustrations are quite impressive, though no doubt they lose something in the translation from three dimensions to two. Notes on the last page identify the insects pictured on each spread. Primary-grade teachers will find this a pleasing and effective introduction to insects. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Letter to an Imaginary Friend: Parts I-IV</h2><p>One of the English language&#39;s great poems available for the first time in one volume.</p><p>Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 1<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 10<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 11<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 12<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 2<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 3<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 4<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 5<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 6<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 7<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 8<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 1, 9<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 1<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 2<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 3<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 4<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 5<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 2, 6<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 3, 1<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 3, 2<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 3, 3<br> Letter To An Imaginary Friend: Part 4<br> -- <i>Table of Poems from Poem Finderï¿½</i><br><br>Written in exile--after the late McGrath was blacklisted from teaching by Joseph McCarthy--this book-length poem is a train ride through half our states during an era when political divisions were deep and stained with blood. Finding the vast landscapes of North Dakota and Alaska forbidding and instructive, <i>Letter</i> is a Western poem, and Beat in its celebration of hobos, drifters, and holy fools. It might have been written by Carl Sandburg, had Sandburg been a hard-boiled socialist instead of a corny populist, and with its angry demands for justice, it might have been written by Pound, had Pound only stayed in Idaho. Recalling the hard life that made the poet radical, <i>Letter</i> shares with all modern long poems a conflict between ideological perspective and imagistic, anecdotal lyric means: "That's how it was. Geeks, Cons and Lemon Men, / Guys with their intellects all ganted up out of the barbarian North / Tea sluggers and cathounds / The girl who, when I said that God had created / Male and female the Spanish Moss, wanted to see them in action. . . ." It lulls, but also startles us awake. <br><i>Copyright ï¿½ 1996, Boston Review. All rights reserved.</i> -- <i>From The Boston Review</i>Every time McGrath (1916^-90) returns to the northern Great Plains upon which he was born, his magnum opus, all four parts of which are here gathered together for the first time, comes to life. The incidents and the landscape of his early life are the most vivid and meaningful for McGrath, and he is clear and concrete when he describes them. The strength of these passages suggests that the <i>Letter</i> as a whole, a personal epic in the tradition inaugurated by Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i>, would be better had McGrath stuck to the actual circumstances of his own life. But he avoids the specifics of his later life and fritters away too much of the big poem playing word games ala James Joyce and spouting radical political sentiments for it to be consistently engrossing. Still, <i>Letter</i> at its best is one of the most readable long modernist poems, far more appealing than, say, either Pound's <i>Cantos</i> or Williams' <i>Paterson</i>. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>War Storm (Red Queen, 4)</h2><p><p><strong>The #1 </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> bestselling Red Queen series comes to a stunning conclusion in <em>War Storm</em>.</strong></p><p>VICTORY COMES AT A PRICE.</p><p>Mare Barrow learned this all too well when Cal&#x2019;s betrayal nearly destroyed her.

Once he realized how I felt he never again let me so much as lean against him while we watched television. I was never allowed to rest my head in his lap, or hold his hand. We gave up our late-night dancing in the kitchen to his favorite records; we stopped camping together. He took away my old hunting rifle, and when I rode behind him on his motorcycle I wasn't allowed to wrap my arms around his waist anymore. I had to let them lie on my own thighs, even when taking sharp corners. </p><p> Colt Pennington, Colt a childhood nickname that stuck. He was tall and leggy and too thin. There's just the one photograph of him as a boy, I think -- he's standing in a dirt yard in Kentucky with two other boys his age. They are all tanned and barefoot and their hair has been buzzed for the summer, and Colt's head is turned, he's laughing at something one of the other boys has said. Just the one picture, and his head is turned. This is a perfect example of, I don't know, I forget, something about...Doors that close? Doors that were already closed before anyone knew they were open? The three of them, Colt and his two friends, don't look like boys today, in the same way child soldiers from the Civil War are foreign looking, so long lost. That is another example but I don't know what the word is. </p><p> His Gramaw Pennington swept the dirt yard but no one else did. She was the last of her kind in this family, out there swishing a broom around in the fine, dry soil, making patterns. The Last Dirt Yard Sweeper, right up until she killed herself with ant poison. I'm unclear on the details. Colt's mother, Juna? Hold a broom? No. There are a couple of pictures of her around here somewhere; Colt kept them. Juna was a clichï¿½ of the worst sort which I know because her type shows up all the time in books and movies, mostly movies, I guess. The too pretty mother who married young and never took to the whole thing, and in the movies there is her rouge and her stockings and the swirl of her skirt as she flies out the door while her little boy begs her to stay -- he stands in the door watching as she gets in a stranger's car and drives away. But Juna wouldn't have been cast in that movie; she lacked the necessary...refinement. In Colt's photographs she's dressed like a singer at the Grand Ole Opry, the costume party equivalent. All Colt saw going out the door was (I'm guessing) some ratty old shoe and a cloud of cigarette smoke. But he kept those photographs: one where she's holding him, he's about two years old and Juna is so miserable one side of her mouth has collapsed -- she has had a stroke of misery. In the other she is modeling her Opry dress (white) (some predecessor to vinyl) and her white boots, along with her big hair which is black like Colt's and does appear to be leading her out of the frame and into whatever her future was, no one knows. </p><p> If only he'd been facing the camera you (I) could see his eyes, which were round, irises so black there was no end to his pupil. Hair from Juna, eyes from his father, Clyde Sr., of whom there are a number of photographs but no one is interested in them. Not much to him, as I understand it -- he was born to be Juna's victim and live in the same house with his widowed mother and give up on raising his only child after the child's mother left,well what was the man to do but walk slumped over every day to his job at the gas station and...am I right -- did his teeth eventually melt? I think so, I think his teeth melted.

His body rang like a piano string: I could hear him coming from miles away, an A note in an upper register, struck and struck and struck again. His hands were ruined with work and before he stopped touching me he would sometimes run his hand over my back and leave a dozen snags in the material of my shirts,he maybe didn't have fingerprints anymore. </p><p> In the winter he drove a '73 Ford truck, an F-100 with a 360, brown -- that specific shade of brown of 1973. The muddy dogs jumped in the front seat, barn boots weren't even wiped in the grass before driving.The floor was littered with every imaginable kind of trash and tool and cast-off work glove (they assumed the shape of his hands),and the bed was scarred from loads of firewood and scrap metal.

She was supposed to be starting a dream journal for the class that began on Monday: Special Topics in Archetypal Psychology, an invitation-only course for senior Honors students who had either majored or minored in psychology. She was also enrolled in another senior seminar, Archetypal Analysis of Literature, available only to English or classics majors. Trace was both. At the last meeting with her adviser, a woman in a wig that had seemed deliberately stripped of color (it looked less like hair than fishing line) and styled to flip up at her shoulders,Trace had been told that in addition to her two majors and the psych minor, she had enough credits to declare minors in humanities and philosophy, and was one class away from a fourth in women's studies. </p><p> "So," Trace said, nodding. </p><p> "So do you want me to add them? You want them listed?" </p><p> "How did they happen, those minors?" </p><p> The adviser, <i>Mizzz Birkle</i>, studied Trace over the top of her half-glasses."You took the classes." </p><p> "Yes," Trace said, trying to remember the past four years. When had she earned minors in four different subjects? </p><p> "You declaring them?" </p><p> "Wouldn't I?" Wouldn't she? Trace wondered if there was a rule somewhere, a code she had broken. </p><p> She tore the pages out of what was supposed to have been her dream journal and stuck them in one of the approximately two hundred unlabeled file folders scattered around the room she slept in. There were three bedrooms upstairs, all oddly shaped and dormered;Trace had chosen the smallest, the one at the back of the house, hoping it would be the easiest to heat. She had found a kind of plastic sheeting that attached to the windows with double-stick tape, and that one then turned into shrink-wrap with a blow-dryer. Having neither a blow-dryer nor electricity, she'd gone to the slick and overpriced store on campus that sold camping supplies (Daredevil Outfitting) and asked a young clerk,who was striving mightily to look gentle and outdoorsy and daring at once, if there was such a thing as a blow-dryer that used batteries. </p><p> "Sure,"he said,walking toward the back of the store. "We've got curling irons, too, but they use propane inserts." </p><p> "Can you weld with them?" </p><p> "I'm sorry?" </p><p> "Nothing -- I'll take the blow-dryer." </p><p> It had worked; Trace had turned the dryer up as high and hot as it would go and directed it at the loose plastic, which became tighter at each spot she focused on, until finally the window was completely sealed.There was still the hole in the ceiling, but she'd covered that with cardboard,and in the end she was glad to have the blow-dryer because on the very worst nights she could put it under her blankets and turn it on,warming the sheets just enough that she and the dog didn't shake in the way she hated, the kind of shivering that hurt. </p><p> She chose a different notebook to serve as her dream journal. There were stacks available to her, as there were file folders and ink pens and sticky notes and index cards.Working at the campus bookstore for four years had fulfilled her every office supply need. She didn't have to steal a thing: if a box of legal pads came in damaged, she was to take them out to the recycling Dumpster and throw them away, then make a note on the Inventory Loss form, which then went to the higher powers for Trace didn't know what -- tax deductions or refunds or perhaps just regret. But in four years at the store (daredevilly named the Campus Book Store) no one had ever watched her recycle anything, nor had they seemed to care.

I think back on how cold Iwas, even then. It is hard to recall, now that I burn with this dry, feverishfire, but cold I certainly was. There was ice built around my heart, years ofit. How could it have been otherwise? The manse at Ochtermill saw to that.<p>I have walked and run through this world pretendingemotions rather than feeling them. Oh, I could feel pain, physical pain, but Ihad to imagine joy, sorrow, anger. As for love, I didn't know what it meant.But I learned early to keep myself well disguised. To the world at large I wasjust Gideon Mack, a dutiful wee boy growing in the shadow of his father and ofthe Kirk.</p><p>As that wee boy I was taught that, solitarythough I might be, I was never alone. Always there was one who walked besideme. I could not see him, but he was there, constant at my side. I wanted toknow him, to love and be loved by him, but he did not reveal himself. Hefrightened me. I had neither the courage to reject him nor the capacity toembrace him.</p><p>This is the hard lesson of my life: love is notin us from the beginning, like an instinct; love is no more original to humanbeings than sin. Like sin, it has to be learned.</p><p>Then I put away childish things, and for years Ithought I saw with the clarity of reason. I did not believe in anything I couldnot see. I mocked at shadows and sprites. That constant companion was not thereat all: I did not believe in him, and he did not reveal himself to me. Yet,through circumstances and through choice, I was to become his servant, aminister of religion. How ironic this is, and yet how natural, as if the pathwere laid out for me from birth, and though I wandered a little from it,distracted or deluded here and there, yet I was always bound to return to itagain.</p><p>And all the while this fire was burning deepinside me. I kept it battened down, the door of the furnace tightly shut,because that seemed necessary in order to through life. I never savoured lifefor what it was: I only wanted to get to the next stage of it. I wish now I'dtaken a little more time, but it is too late for such regrets. I was like thechild in the cinema whose chief anticipation lies not in the film but inwondering what he will do after it is over; I was the reader who hurriesthrough a 500 page novel not to see what will happen but simply to get to theend. And now, despite everything, I am there, and for this I must thank thatother companion, in whom also I did not believe, but who has shown me a waythrough the shadows and beyond the shadows.</p><p>I have not preached for weeks, yet I am full oftexts. If I am a prophet then I have yet to be heard. If I am Jonah, then thefish has vomited me out but nobody believes where I have been: nobody exceptthe one who saved me from the belly of hell. Who am I? I am Gideon Mack,time server, charlatan, hypocrite, God's groveling, apologist; the man who sawthe Stone, the man that was drowned and that the waters gave back, the madminister who met with the Devil and lived to tell the tale. And hence my thirdnon Scriptural text, for what is religion if not a kind of madness, and what ismadness without a touch of religion? And yet there is peace and sanctuary inreligion too&#x2014;it is the asylum to which all poor crazed sinners may comeat last, the door which will always open to us if we can find the courage toknock.</p><p>Few suspected it, but all my life was a lie fromthe age of nine (when, through deceit, I almost succeeded in killing myfather); all my words were spoken with the tongue of a serpent, and what love Igave or felt came from a dissembling heart. Then I saw the Stone, and nothingwas the same again. This is my testimony. Read it and believe it, or believe itnot. You may judge me a liar, a cheat, a madman, I do not care. I am beyondquestions of probity or sanity now. I am at the gates of the realm ofknowledge, and one day soon I will pass through them.</p></p><h2>Treasures of Islam: Artistic Glories of the Muslim World</h2><p>Discover the grandeur of Islam in a vivid portrait of some of the greatest and most creative civilizations ever to have existed a wide range of peoples and cultures all united spiritually by their adherence to Islam and its holy book. This important survey which features outstanding production values, an oversized volume, a foil-trimmed cover, and special five-color printing celebrates the remarkable diversity of Muslim art, from beautiful textiles and peerless ceramics to awe-inspiring architecture and exquisite metalwork. With superb photography throughout, this guide marries the religion&#x2019;s artistic legacy with its rich history, travelling from the royal mosque at Isfahan to the beauty of Quranic illumination.</p><p>Bernard O&#39;Kane is Professor of Islamic Art and Architecture at The American University in Cairo. His previous appointments include Visiting Professorships at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States, while his many publications include The Iconography of Islamic Art (2005) and Early Persian Painting (2003).In this sumptuous volume, O'Kane combines an overview of Islamic art and architecture with a cursory history of Islam's empires and dynasties. Beginning with a brief discussion of the earliest mosque from the seventh century, and showing how Islamic architects created a distinctive artistic tradition, O'Kane (<i>The Iconography of Islamic Art</i>) follows architectural and artistic ideas to the 19th century. Major monuments, such as the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Great Mosque of Damascus, the Sultan Hasan mosque in Cairo, the Alhambra in Moorish Spain and the Taj Mahal, are highlighted, as are many works of art, including colorful mosaics, lace-like wood and stone carvings and exquisite manuscript paintings. O'Kane stresses the significance of religious and secular symbolism, and points out the craftsmanship that makes this art a feast for the eye. He does a credible job of surveying a vast panorama of art and culture, but it's difficult to compress so much complex material into one volume. The wealth of glorious full-color illustrations make this beautifully designed book an excellent introduction to the art of Islam. <i>(Oct. 24)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For nearly twenty years Lago has researched the Powell expedition from new angles, traveled to thirteen states, and looked into archives and other sources no one else has searched. He has come up with many important new documents that change and expand our basic understanding of the expedition by looking into Powell&#x2019;s crewmembers, some of whom have been almost entirely ignored by Powell historians. Historians tended to assume that Powell was the whole story and that his crewmembers were irrelevant. More seriously, because several crew members made critical comments about Powell and his leadership, historians who admired Powell were eager to ignore and discredit them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lago offers a feast of new and important material about the river trip, and it will significantly rewrite the story of Powell&#x2019;s famous expedition. This book is not only a major work on the Powell expedition, but on the history of American exploration of the West.</p><p>Don Lago is one of the most respected historians of the Grand Canyon, and the author of <i>Grand Canyon: A History of a Natural Wonder and National Park</i>. He has published more than 50 personal essays in national magazines and literary journals. His latest book is <i>Where the Sky Touched the Earth: Cosmological Landscapes of the Southwest</i>. He lives in Flagstaff, Arizona.John Wesley Powell&#x2019;s 1869 expedition down the Green and Colorado Rivers&nbsp;and through the Grand Canyon is one of the few feats of American exploration&nbsp;that ranks with the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Apollo landings on the&nbsp;moon. In terms of sheer life-and-death struggle in a dramatic landscape, the&nbsp;Powell expedition might be the most dramatic story of them all. As America&#x2019;s&nbsp;frontier era has grown smaller in our national rearview mirror, many of our&nbsp;frontier heroes have shrunk, too, mainly because those heroes were agents of&nbsp;Manifest Destiny who viewed the land, wildlife, and Native Americans as obstacles&nbsp;to conquer and resources to exploit. Powell, however, has gained stature&nbsp;over time. Powell was first of all a scientist with a deep curiosity about nature,&nbsp;and this curiosity motivated his explorations. Because Powell viewed the landscape&nbsp;and waterscape as a scientist, he realized that the arid West couldn&#x2019;t fit&nbsp;into America&#x2019;s Manifest Destiny dreams, and thus he became a pioneering conservationist.<br><br> As one of the founders of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology in 1879,&nbsp;Powell studied Native American life with much more respect than most of his&nbsp;contemporaries. In recent decades millions of Americans have taken up river&nbsp;running and have appointed Powell one of the patron saints of river runners.&nbsp;For these reasons and more, interest in Powell has been growing, generating&nbsp;some valuable books about him and his expedition.&nbsp;A century ago Robert Stanton, who led the next expedition down the&nbsp;Colorado River after Powell&#x2019;s, wrote a long book on Colorado River history &#x2014;in fact, it was so long no publisher wanted it. Stanton&#x2019;s first words in his book&nbsp;were, &#x201c;Why another book on the Colorado River?&#x201d;1 If Stanton already believed&nbsp;he had to justify his Colorado River history book, then it&#x2019;s only fair that readers&nbsp;today, after a century of additional books, should ask if there can be any new&nbsp;discoveries about it, or at least discoveries of any significance.&nbsp;The answer is &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; a surprisingly strong &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; There are enough new&nbsp;discoveries to substantially rewrite the story of the Powell expedition.<br><br> This book had a simple beginning. Books about the Powell expedition&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t say much about his crewmember William Hawkins except that he was&nbsp;from Missouri. I am also from Missouri, and so was curious to know more&nbsp;of Hawkins&#x2019;s story. Was he from my own neighborhood? How did he come&nbsp;to join the Powell expedition? As I looked into Hawkins&#x2019;s story, I was startled&nbsp;to discover a case of mistaken identity: the guy in the history books was the&nbsp;wrong guy. Back in the 1940s Powell&#x2019;s first major biographer, William Culp&nbsp;Darrah, had looked for Hawkins but latched onto the Civil War record of&nbsp;someone else and put him into the history books, with the wrong birthdate,&nbsp;wrong birthplace, wrong family, wrong military record, even the wrong name.&nbsp;All subsequent historians had simply copied Darrah&#x2019;s homework, not looking&nbsp;into original sources, and perpetuated his mistake. Looking further, I found&nbsp;that some of Darrah&#x2019;s other statements about Hawkins had no source in the&nbsp;historical record, and in fact the record contradicted them. Darrah had portrayed&nbsp;Hawkins as a criminal, a fugitive, a liar, a shady character. Again, subsequent&nbsp;historians had simply repeated Darrah&#x2019;s image. Yet when I looked into&nbsp;the sources, it appeared that Darrah had twisted some evidence and fabricated&nbsp;other claims. His motives were not hard to guess: In his later years Hawkins&nbsp;had written two strong denunciations of Powell&#x2019;s leadership of the expedition.&nbsp;Darrah greatly admired Powell and wanted to defend his reputation, so he was&nbsp;eager to discredit Hawkins, to the point of dishonesty. I was to discover that&nbsp;this was only one of several times Darrah cooked the books to make Powell look better in his book.<br><br> The biographies of most of the other crewmembers were also skimpy, and&nbsp;I became curious about them, too. I soon found that they also had untold&nbsp;stories &#x2014; important stories. I found documents about them, and also found&nbsp;their living families. Historians had never located, and hardly tried to find,&nbsp;the families of Oramel and Seneca Howland and William Dunn, who left the&nbsp;expedition near the end and left us with two big controversies: why they left&nbsp;and why they disappeared without a trace. All along, for a century and a half,&nbsp;the Howland and Dunn families had passed from one generation to the next&nbsp;letters, photos, family memories, and documents about their ancestors. Such&nbsp;discoveries not only told the stories of the crewmembers, but also began to&nbsp;suggest new explanations for some of the events of the expedition. Powell&#x2019;s&nbsp;crew included two of the most famous names in America in the 1860s: Howland&nbsp;and Sumner. The Howlands were a Mayflower family, whose early start&nbsp;in America helped them to become very successful and rich. The Sumners included&nbsp;one of America&#x2019;s most powerful politicians. When I learned more about&nbsp;Howland family history and placed the Powell expedition within its context,&nbsp;I saw new reasons why the Howland brothers might have decided to leave the&nbsp;expedition. When I learned more about Sumner family history, I saw a new&nbsp;reason why Jack Sumner might have decided not to leave the expedition. The&nbsp;background stories of William Hawkins and Bill Dunn also offered new hints&nbsp;about their decisions about leaving or not leaving the expedition.<br><br> Historians have neglected the crewmembers, and some other important&nbsp;stories, because most were drawn to this subject out of admiration for John&nbsp;Wesley Powell. Like scientists who rely on paradigms to organize data into a&nbsp;coherent story, historians often start out accepting some basic stories, some&nbsp;assumptions about what happened or what events mean. Powell historians assumed&nbsp;that Powell was the whole story, that his crewmembers were peripheral&nbsp;characters: it hardly mattered who they were, where they were from, or what&nbsp;their motives were. Thus, historians&#x2019; research agendas were centered on Powell.<br><br> Even historians who were inclined to debunking, such as Otis &#x2014; better known&nbsp;as Dock &#x2014; Marston, nevertheless remained Powell-centric&nbsp;in their research&nbsp;agendas. Historians for whom Powell was a personal hero, especially Darrah&nbsp;&nbsp;and Wallace Stegner, were eager to defend Powell from the written criticisms of&nbsp;crewmembers Hawkins and Sumner and the implied criticism of the Howland&nbsp;brothers and Bill Dunn, whose abandonment of the trip could be taken as as a&nbsp;sign of their dissatisfaction with Powell&#x2019;s leadership. Thus Darrah and Stegner&nbsp;were downright eager to ignore Hawkins and Sumner. But at least Hawkins&nbsp;and Sumner got their names on the Powell Memorial on the canyon South Rim&nbsp;in Grand Canyon National Park. Other Powell admirers, especially Frederick&nbsp;Dellenbaugh, who was the chronicler of his second expedition, made sure that&nbsp;the Howland brothers and Bill Dunn were branded as deserters and that their&nbsp;names were left off the memorial.<br><br> Another factor in focusing research on Powell was that two of Powell&#x2019;s&nbsp;biographers, Wallace Stegner and Donald Worster, were environmental historians&#x2014; and very important ones &#x2014; who were mainly interested in Powell the&nbsp;environmental prophet. Both Stegner and Worster did good jobs of placing&nbsp;Powell within the context of his times. Yet neither was nearly as interested in&nbsp;Powell the river explorer; for them the river expedition was just the prelude to&nbsp;the more important story. Biographical details about Powell&#x2019;s crewmembers&nbsp;were largely irrelevant to their purposes. For information about the crew,&nbsp;Stegner,&nbsp;Worster, and other historians relied heavily on Darrah&#x2019;s research. We&nbsp;do owe Darrah a large debt, for in the 1940s, when people who had personally&nbsp;known Powell and his crew were dying out, Darrah amassed a valuable collection&nbsp;of documents. Yet Darrah had his own agenda. In the course of this book,&nbsp;we will explore some interesting cases in historiography, of how history gets&nbsp;written. For instance, another historian perpetrated a hoax regarding the fate&nbsp;of the Howland brothers and Bill Dunn.<br><br> I also dug deeper into Powell&#x2019;s story and came up with several important&nbsp;stories that had gone unnoticed. I visited archives and checked out leads no&nbsp;one had thought to explore, found documents that cast new light on various&nbsp;elements of the expedition, and made new connections between people and&nbsp;events. Some of these connections came from placing the Powell expedition in&nbsp;the context of the social, political, and cultural forces of his time. The Powell&nbsp;expedition did not take place in a vacuum, but was embedded in historical&nbsp;currents often as strong as the river currents that propelled their boats.<br><br> This book includes several parts. Part I takes a deep look into one of the&nbsp;longstanding controversies of Colorado River history: Was John Wesley Powell&nbsp;really the first person to go through the Grand Canyon? In 1867 a battered&nbsp;man&nbsp;named James White showed up on a crude raft downriver from the canyon.&nbsp;Ever since, people have debated whether he could or could not, did or did not&nbsp;make it through the canyon. White&#x2019;s own testimony was vague enough that&nbsp;people can make a plausible case either way. Most of this debate has taken place&nbsp;in a vacuum, with insufficient facts for a foundation. In an archive no one else&nbsp;checked, I located a U.S. Army document that gives an authoritative account of&nbsp;one part of White&#x2019;s story to which we can compare White&#x2019;s version of events. I&nbsp;also look deeper into some of the other elements of his story. Powell&#x2019;s fame has&nbsp;always been tangled up with the James White mystery, so it is appropriate that&nbsp;a book on Powell begins with White.<br><br> The heart of this book consists of the chapters on the crewmembers. In&nbsp;a symbolic reversal of the usual pattern of Powell books, I have placed these&nbsp;chapters in part II, before the chapters on Powell. Part III covers Powell, and&nbsp;part IV is on the origins of some of the names the expedition gave to one of&nbsp;their boats, and to a canyon. Part V is on the ending of the expedition, which&nbsp;was recorded by two outsiders, and on the fate of one of the boats.&nbsp;Finally, part VI offers a deeper exploration of another of the longstanding&nbsp;mysteries and controversies about the expedition: the fate of the Howland<br> brothers and Bill Dunn. I examine the two leading theories of what happened&nbsp;to them. Here, too, there are important new documents and facts to consider.<br><br> When we explore the life of William Hawkins after the expedition, it casts a&nbsp;startling new light on his claim, totally ignored by Powell historians, that he&nbsp;buried the bodies of his crewmembers. The Howland brothers had another&nbsp;brother who conducted a private investigation into the fate of his brothers, and&nbsp;his correspondence with Mormon leaders has remained in Howland family&nbsp;hands, unknown until now. In exploring the political events and contexts&nbsp;of southern Utah in 1869, we find and follow a scenario that has not been&nbsp;imagined&nbsp;before.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Wall Pieces (Ceramics Handbook)</h2><p>Using clay in a contemporary manner for wall space is an increasingly fashionable and innovative solution both for decorators, architects and makers. Wall pieces are the perfect solution for those who enjoy sculpture but have no space; they fulfill the same function as a picture while being much more dynamic and three-dimensional. Current wall pieces vary enormously from simple tiled pieces to huge installations, and this book looks at the huge variety of work being made, as well as all the problems, solutions and diverse approaches to wall pieces. The book gives an insight into the work of contemporary makers, exploring how to plan, design, make, mount and safely hang ceramic pieces. It's also illustrated with a wide selection of original and inspiring work by contemporary ceramic artists.<br><br><b>Pushing the Boundaries</b><br> Over the last decade, the innovation and determination of ceramicists to push the boundaries of clay as well as people's perceptions of the material has been both surprising and exciting. <i>Wall Pieces</i> offers inspiration for a material that's extremely versatile, natural and beautiful. You'll get an insight into how makers from all over the world are working with clay and the wall space in an exciting and dynamic manner. This book also provides some technical information and guidelines to help get you started in designing, creating and hanging your own wall piece.<br>The fascination with the decoration of a wall's surface is not a recent concept but can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt, where they decorated their walls with stories of the gods using oxides painted directly on a surface and in some cases using ceramic tiles. Although ceramic wall pieces have evolved and changed from the use of the tile, the concept of decorating and expanding an idea, pattern and visual relief across a surface or a whole room is present throughout history and continues to this day.<br><br><b>Short History</b><br><br> Anne Mercedes contributes the first part of the book with an overview of what wall pieces are, and how they fit into the contemporary scene, with a look at their historical origins in other forms, and how they have evolved. More and more artists and designers working with ceramics are showing an interest in making wall pieces, and finding ways of producing large-scale work for which they may not have been trained. Achieving these projects often involves working in collaboration, so Mercedes briefly examines the practical and economic factors influencing the different forms of collaboration. The projects examined provide examples of different types of wall pieces, and highlight the social and economic developments relevant to anyone wishing to undertake projects of this kind.<br><br><b>Designing and Planning</b><br><br> Before embarking on the making of a wall piece it's essential to take time to plan and design your idea. Segurado provides some pointers to help you consider design issues and think about planning, as well as information on how other makers have used design planning to create a number of successful wall pieces. One of the first and most important steps is to take time to consider the location, as this could have a strong influence on the starting points of the design, scale, weight and overall aesthetic. This will then influence your choice of materials and methods suitable to create your piece of work. In this way, making wall pieces involves a reversal of the usual approach, where an artist will often create a piece, and then consider how and where to display it. Wall pieces, at least for the larger works, are often location-led, and where they are to be located may dictate their design, style and atmosphere. <br><br></p><p>Dominique Bivar Segurado has been making ceramics since 1999 and has taught ceramics in various colleges, as well as doing an artist's residency in Taiwan in 2005 and being selected to tour Japan in 2008 by the Arts Council. <br><br> Anne Mercedes was born in Paris and taught philosophy both in France and the UK before undertaking her ceramics degree in 2007 at the University of Westminster.

Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted that Punjab's new capital, Chandigarh, should be a symbol of the nation's faith in the future, unfettered by the traditions of the past. Its design and construction galvanized national attention, and Le Corbusier, the icon of European architectural modernism, was invited to help remake India's national ideal.<br><br>Le Corbusier arrived in 1950, in the twilight of his career. He set to work alternately wooing and clashing with Nehru and with the Indian planners and builders, prevailing ultimately only in the design of the Capitol Complex and a few buildings in the Museum Complex, as well as in his enduring symbol of peace and nonalignment, the Open Hand.<br><br>Vikramaditya Prakash tells the fascinating story that lies behind the planning and architecture of Chandigarh. Drawing on his intimate knowledge of the city, where he grew up as the son of one of the nine Indian architects who assisted in designing Chandigarh, Prakash brings to light stories of town planners, bureaucrats, and architects vying over the colonial past and the symbolic future of India. Different conceptions of the modern and the role of Indian civilization clashed and coalesced in a process that highlights the mutual interdependence of "East" and "West," and the fact that architecture and aesthetics cannot be separated from ideological claims and political implications.<br><br>Prakash skillfully unfolds the intricate layers of the Capitol's symbolism, tracing the cultural preconceptions and influences that produced Le Corbusier's understanding of India and animated his obsessions, desires, and aspirations. Chandigarh's Le Corbusier is the story of the making of an Indian modern architecture as both an aspect and an engine of post-colonial culture.</p><p><p>Describes the creation of the new capital of Punjab in 1947</p>Vikramaditya Prakash is Chair of the Department of Architecture, University of Washington.</p><h2>Blind Justice: A Novel</h2><p>When a childhood friend is accused of murder, disgraced criminal lawyer Jake Denney struggles to overcome his alcoholism and renew his career in order to defend his client against the evil forces that threaten to destroy them both.

During his long career as an academic and researcher in nineteenth century France, Bï¿½champ was widely known and respected as both a teacher and a researcher. As a leading academic, his work was well documented in scientific circles. Few made as much use of this fact as Louis Pasteur, who based much of his career on plagiarising and distorting Bï¿½champ&#39;s research; in doing so, Pasteur secured for himself an undeserved place in the history of medical science. The Blood and its Third Element is Bï¿½champ&#39;s explanation of his position, and his defense of it against Pasteur&#39;s mischief. This final major work of Bï¿½champ&#39;s embodies the culmination of his life&#39;s research. This book contains, in detail, the elements of the microzymian theory of the organization of living organisms and organic materials. It has immediate and far reaching relevance to the fields of immunology, bacteriology, and cellular biology; and it shows that more than 100 years ago, the germ, or microbian, theory of disease was demonstrated by Bï¿½champ to be without foundation. There is no single cause of disease. The ancients thought this, and Bï¿½champ proved it and was written out of history for his trouble. The relevance of his work to the dilemmas that plague modern medical science remains as yet unrealized. This is a new edition of this title. The text has been extensively re-edited for today&#39;s reader.</p><p></p><h2>Fix-It and Enjoy-It Healthy Cookbook: 400 Great Stove-Top And Oven Recipes</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you believe it?

While in the hospital, Sadako learns to fold origami cranes and believes that folding the cranes might lead to the granting of a wish. A loving and compassionate child, Sadako's life inspires her classmates to create a memorial in her honor, to remember all the children impacted by war.</p><p>Filled with new illustrations and photos of Sadako and her family never before seen by the public, Masahiro Sasaki, Sadako's older brother, and Sue DiCicco, founder of The Peace Crane Project, tell Sadako's complete story in English for the first time.</p><p>Proceeds from this book are shared equally between <em>The Sadako Legacy NPO</em> and <em>The Peace Crane Project</em>.</p><p> </p></p><p>Sue DiCicco began her career as a Disney Animator, one of the first women to achieve that position. In addition to her work as an animator, Sue is a sculptor, and prolific author/illustrator of books for children, including "Origami Peace Cranes, Friendships Take Flight," a story designed to encourage connection and friendship through origami cranes. An early pioneer of the Internet, Sue designed and created the world's first online schoolhouse, serving up to 300,000 school children per event in the 1990s. Propelled by a desire to creatively connect students from every corner of the world in a vision of peace, Sue founded The Peace Crane Project in 2012. In addition to hosting the Peace Crane Project, Sue now speaks at venues globally, inviting listeners to explore and embrace the power and the potential of the Internet to connect students in creating a more understanding, educated, integrated, and peaceful future.<br><br>Masahiro Sasaki, Sadako's older brother, was born in Hiroshima in 1941. Masahiro, along with Sadako, were exposed to the atomic bombing in 1945. As a teenager, he joined the Acting Construction Committee to build The Children's Monument of the Atomic Bomb, completed in 1958. Since 2000, Masahiro has dedicated himself to sharing Sadako's true story, and the plight of all atomic war survivors with the world. Masahiro received the Hiroshima Citizen's Award in 2007 and was awarded the Spirit of America Award from the National Council for the Social Studies, the first non-American to receive it. He established The Sadako Legacy, a nonprofit organization, in 2009. To inspire others, he has donated Sadako's cranes to venues all around the world. Today, Masahiro gives lectures globally and promotes activities to connect people for peace.<p>"My grandfather, <strong>Harry S. Truman</strong>, never spoke to me about the atomic bombings of Japan. Like most Americans, I learned about them in school. Textbooks didn't give me much more than casualty figures. Nothing about what really happened to the people on the ground. Sadako Sasaki's story was the first human story of the bombings I'd ever read. It led me to Masahiro and two visits to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the second, with my son, Wesley, to record survivor testimony for the Truman Presidential Library. In all that time, Masahiro rarely told his own version of his family's story, preferring to focus on his sister's courage and selflessness. Now, we have the full story of the courage and selflessness of the entire Sasaki family, their friends and the people of Hiroshima." <br> <strong>Clifton Truman Daniel, Grandson of President Harry S. Truman </strong></p><p>"Born in Hiroshima in 1943, Sadako Sasaki was two years old when she experienced the atomic bombing. She lived life as fully as she could, but it was cut short at the young age of twelve. The powerful message she proclaimed throughout her entire life still resonates with us all: Peace in our world can be achieved not through holding grudges but through striving to live our lives with compassion for others. Hope will be born from overcoming our differences, from profound understanding of one another, and from respect for our fellow human beings."<br> <strong>Kazumi Matsui, Mayor, Hiroshima, Japan </strong></p><p>"Through reading the story of Sadako Sasaki you will know that the abolition of nuclear weapons and the rejection of war are the only path to survival for mankind. As you read the unbearable tragedy brought by the atomic bombing, you will learn the real meaning of 'to live' from Sadako, who patiently fought against an incurable disease that was so hard to endure. I hope you make many friends through the symbolic 'paper crane' left to us by Sadako. Please build a peaceful future together."<br> <strong>Dr. Tadatoshi Akiba, Former Mayor, Hiroshima, Japan </strong></p><p>"When children make a crane it gives them a personal connection to a tragedy that they might otherwise not grasp because it's horrific dimensions surpass normal imagination. Focusing on one person's story opens the possibility of becoming engaged in the abolition of nuclear weapons. If a mere one hundred explode every person's life on this frail planet will suffer beyond normal imagination and we must never let that happen."<br> <strong>Jonathan Granoff, President, Global Security Institute</strong></p><p>"<em>The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki</em> reminds us of our essential goodness and belongs in libraries, classrooms, and homes everywhere. Sadako inspires us to connect with others, recognize their needs, and act accordingly regardless of our personal circumstances. <em>Omoiyari-no-</em><em>kokoro</em>, the act of showing empathy and concern, is demonstrated over and over again, as both Sadako and the authors offer us an opportunity to understand the joy of living beyond ourselves."<br> <strong>Dr. Dorothy J. Maver, President, National Peace Academy </strong></p><p>"This book tells the story of a young girl, Sadako Sasaki, an innocent victim of war. While in the hospital, twelve-year-old Sadako folded more than one thousand paper cranes in the hope of recovering from her atomic bomb-induced disease. The book was written to inform young readers of Sadako's struggle and to inspire them to take action for peace. I believe it succeeds on both counts."<br> <strong>Dr. David Krieger, President, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation </strong></p></p><h2>Counsels on diet and foods: A compilation from the writings of Ellen G. White (Christian home library)</h2><p>Guidelines on a Healthy Diet Decades before many physiologists were concerned with the close relationship between diet and health, Ellen G. White in her writings clearly pointed out the connection between the food we eat and our physical and spiritual welfare. In her discourses and writings from 1863 onward, she discussed frequently the importance of diet and adequate nutrition. Her counsels, as preserved in pamphlets and books, in the journals of the denomination, and in personal testimonies, have exerted a strong influence on the dietetic habits of Seventh-day Adventists, and indirectly have left their impress upon the general public. In assembling the materials comprising Counsels on Diet and Foods, an effort was made to include the full range of instruction on the subject from Mrs. White&#39;s pen. The resulting compilation is unique for it presents the counsels clustered topically under a general heading, with no attempt to provide a continuity in reading.</p><p></p><h2>A Century of Olympic Posters</h2><p>As snapshots through time, Olympic posters provide a fascinating record of our world, a lens through which we can explore links between sports and art, politics and place, commerce and culture. <i>A Century of Olympic Posters</i> offers an intensely visual representation of the modern Games, and shows the evolution of the Olympic Games poster as well, from the first official poster for Stockholm in 1912 right up to the present.<br><br>This diverse range of images includes official posters for the Summer and Winter Games set in their historical context, and linked to pervading themes such as politics, commerce, the Olympic symbols, cultural and physical diversity, and urban regeneration.</p><p>Margaret Timmers is a curator based in the Word &amp; Image Department of the V&amp;A.

Renowned for his inventiveness as well as for his bombast and irascibility, Randel was central to Manhattan&#x2019;s development but died in financial ruin. Telling Randel&#x2019;s engrossing and dramatic life story for the first time, this eye-opening biography introduces an unheralded pioneer of American engineering and mapmaking.</p><p>Charged with &#x201c;gridding&#x201d; what was then an undeveloped, hilly island, Randel recorded the contours of Manhattan down to the rocks on its shores. He was obsessed with accuracy and steeped in the values of the Enlightenment, in which math and science promised dominion over nature. The result was a series of maps, astonishing in their detail and precision, which undergird our knowledge about the island today. During his varied career Randel created surveying devices, designed an early elevated subway, and proposed a controversial alternative route for the Erie Canal&#x2015;winning him admirers and enemies.</p><p><em>The Measure of Manhattan</em> is more than just the life of an unrecognized engineer. It is about the ways in which surveying and cartography changed the ground beneath our feet. Bringing Randel&#x2019;s story into the present, Holloway travels with contemporary surveyors and scientists trying to envision Manhattan as a wild island once again.</p><p>Illustrated with dozens of historical images and antique maps, <em>The Measure of Manhattan</em> is an absorbing story of a fascinating man that captures the era when Manhattan&#x2015;indeed, the entire country&#x2015;still seemed new, the moment before canals and railroads helped draw a grid across the American landscape.</p> 53 illustrations</p><p>Marguerite Holloway, the director of Science and Environmental Journalism at Columbia University, has written for Scientific American, Discover, the New York Times, Natural History, and Wired.

A Mystery so awesome that we insulate ourselves from its intensity. To numb our fear of the unknown we desensitize ourselves to the miracle of living. We perpetuate the nonchalant lie that we know who we are and what life is. Yet behind this preposterous bluff the Mystery remains unchanging, waiting for us to remember to wonder. It is waiting in a shaft of sunlight, in the thought of death, in the intoxication of new love, in the joy of childbirth or the shock of loss. One minute we are going about our business as if life were nothing special and the next we are face to face with profound, unfathomable, breathtaking Mystery. This is both the origin and consummation of the spiritual quest.<br><br>Although the conditions of life have changed continually throughout history, the Mystery of life has remained the same. This is a book about a remarkable group of men and women who, some 2,000 years ago, were touched by the Mystery and dared to plumb its depths. Revolutionary<br><br>free-thinkers who synthesized the available wisdom of the world and articulated perennial truths in dynamic, innovative ways. Creative visionaries who encoded their teachings in extraordinary myths. Explorers of Consciousness whose mystical philosophy promised 'Gnosis' - experiential Knowledge of Truth. These forgotten spiritual pioneers could not have conceived of the unparalleled impact they would have on the history of humanity. Who were they? They called themselves 'Christians'.<br><br>It was these radical individualists who inadvertently created the most authoritarian religion in history. Their questioning mysticism was distorted, almost beyond recognition, into the dogmatic creed of what they called an 'imitation church'.2 When this impoverished form of Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the brutal Roman Empire, the original Christians were violently suppressed, their scriptures burned and their memory all but erased. The Roman Church fabricated its own account of the origins of Christianity, still believed today, which dismisses the first Christians as a minor cult of obscure heretics. But it was these brilliant mythographers who authored a story which continues to dominate the spiritual imagination of the Western world. From the archaic allegory of a dying and resurrecting Son of God they fashioned a new and vibrant myth which has captured the hearts and minds of millions: the fable of a Jewish peasant who saved the world: the story of Jesus the Christ.<br><br>The Good News<br><br>For the original Christians, the Jesus story was a myth used to introduce beginners to the spiritual path. For those wishing to go deeper than the 'Outer Mysteries', which were only 'for the masses', there were secret teachings or 'Inner Mysteries'.#3 These were 'the secret traditions of true Gnosis' which, according to the 'Church Father' Clement of Alexandria, were transmitted 'to a small number by a succession of masters'.4# Those initiated into these Inner Mysteries discovered that Christianity was not just about the dying and resurrecting Son of God. They were told another myth that few Christians today have even heard of - the story of Jesus' lover, the lost and redeemed Daughter of the Goddess.<br><br>Amongst the original Christians the divine was seen as having both<br><br>a masculine and feminine face. They related to the Divine Feminine as Sophia, the wise Goddess.5# Paul tells us, 'Among the initiates we speak of Sophia', for it is 'the secret of Sophia' that is 'taught in our Mysteries'.#6 When initiates of the Inner Mysteries of Christianity partook of Holy Communion, it was Sophia's passion and suffering they remembered.7# Amongst the original Christians, priests and priestesses would offer initiates wine as a symbol of 'her blood'.8# The prayer would be offered: 'May Sophia fill your inner being and increase in you her Gnosis.'9# It was Sophia who was petitioned:<br><br>'Come, hidden Mother; come, you who are made manifest in your works, and give joy and rest to those who are bound to you. Come and partake in this Eucharist which we perform in your name, and in the love feast for which we have assembled at your invitation.'#10<br><br>The eradication of this Christian Goddess by the patriarchal Roman Church has left us all motherless children. Women have been denied a sympathetic rapport with the Divine Feminine. Men have been denied a love-affair with a female face of Deity. Spirituality has become part of the battleground which separates the sexes, when it should be the sanctuary of eternal<br><br>fellowship. The original Christians, however, practised 'partnership spirituality'. They valued men and women equally, as expressions of God and Goddess. They saw the division of the sexes as a correlate of that primal duality which is the source of creation, a duality that when made one, as in the act of love, brings the bliss of union that they called 'Gnosis'.<br><br>For the original Christians the Jesus story appears at the end of a cycle of Christian myths which begins with the ineffable Mystery manifesting itself as a primordial Father and Mother and culminates in the mystical marriage of Jesus and Sophia. The Inner Mysteries reveal these myths as allegories of spiritual initiation, symbolic stories which encode a profound philosophy with the power to transform an initiate from a Christian into a Christ.#11<br><br>For the original Christians the 'gospel' or 'good news' is not a story written in a book. Rather they taught that: 'The gospel is the Gnosis.'#12 The good news is that a complete transformation of consciousness is<br><br>possible. The good news is that there is a way to transcend suffering. The good news is that there is a natural state of happiness which is our birthright. This is the gospel of absolute freedom. It is not a set of rules which we must follow to become 'good'. It is about discovering our own essential nature, which is good already, so that we can live spontaneously. This gospel holds out the extraordinary promise that those who understand it 'will not taste death'.13# But immortality is not access to Heaven as reward for living an upright life. It is the immediate realization, here and now, of our true identity, which was never born and so can never die.<br><br>A Journey of Initiation<br><br>This book is an exploration of the gospel of Gnosis. Our aim has been to present a radical alternative to the traditional picture of who the original Christians were and what they believed. Like all spiritual movements, early Christianity covered a broad spectrum of individuals and schools with differing levels of perception, so we have chosen to focus on what we regard as their best and most enduring insights, which may still be valid for us today.<br><br>Why isn't the gospel of Gnosis common knowledge? First, because the Roman Church has spent over 16 centuries systematically destroying<br><br>the evidence that it ever existed. For much of this time, merely to possess Christian works unacceptable to the established Church was punishable by a cruel death. Thankfully some of these texts have nevertheless survived. In recent decades they have been augmented by fabulous archaeological finds such as the discovery of a library of 'heretical' Christian scriptures in a cave near Nag Hammadi in Egypt. The implications of this find, and the advances in our understanding of early Christianity that it has led to, have yet to be widely appreciated.<br><br>Inadequate translation has also played a significant role in disguis-<br><br>ing the secret teachings of Christianity encoded in the New Testament gospels and alluded to frequently by Paul in his letters. Rendering these works into familiar 'churchy' English lulls us into the reassuring illusion that we have understood what is being said, when in fact we have not even begun to scratch the surface of the real significance of the original Greek. The 'heretical' Christian gospels, on the other hand, are regularly rendered into unfamiliar English, making them sound strange and inaccessible. One translator was even in the habit of remarking that such texts were 'not supposed to make any sense'.#14 Little wonder, then, that an artificial division has been created between the orthodox canon and other Christian gospels. However, when the New Testament Jesus story is understood in its original context, as part of the whole Christian myth cycle, and the 'heretical' gospels are interpreted sympathetically, they can, at last, be seen as expressions of one profound mystical philosophy.<br><br>In our examination of these texts we have made one assumption which other commentators often do not make: that our ancestors were not idiots. We have postulated that although they lived in very different physical conditions, they still faced the same great enigmas of existence as we do today and that their answers are potentially as valuable as contemporary views. We have, in short, approached the people we are studying with the respect which they deserve and which they have been denied for nearly two millennia.<br><br>Academics have often failed lamentably to understand the spirituality of the original Christians because they have lacked mystical insight. The Gnosis is not an intellectual theory. It is a state of being. It is an inner 'Knowledge' which can never be truly understood from the outside. Trying to comment on the Gnosis without ever having personally experienced its life-changing impact is like writing a travelogue for a country you have never visited. Any native would find it laughably absurd. We approach this work not only with a commitment to rigorous scholarship, but also as lifelong students of experiential mysticism. We are not, however, members of any cult or affiliated to any religious organization. This, we feel, makes us ideally placed to take up the challenge of recovering the ancient Gnosis for modern readers.<br><br>New ideas can take decades to travel from scholarly circles to t...</p><h2>Women After All: Sex, Evolution, and the End of Male Supremacy</h2><p><p><strong>A lively, richly informed argument for the natural superiority of women from the acclaimed author of <em>The Tangled Wing</em>.</strong></p><p>There is a human genetic fluke that is surprisingly common, due to a change in a key pair of chromosomes. In the normal condition the two look the same, but in this disorder one is malformed and shrunken beyond recognition. The result is a shortened life span, higher mortality at all ages, an inability to reproduce, premature hair loss, and brain defects variously resulting in attention deficit, hyperactivity, conduct disorder, hypersexuality, and an enormous excess of both outward and self-directed aggression.</p><p>It is called maleness.</p><p>In <em>Women After All</em>, Melvin Konner traces the arc of evolution to explain the relationships between women and men. With patience and wit he explores the knotty question of whether men are necessary in the biological destiny of the human race. He draws on multiple, colorful examples from the natural world&#x2015;such as the mating habits of the octopus, black widow, angler fish, and jacana&#x2015;and argues that maleness in humans is hardly necessary to the survival of the species.</p><p>In characteristically humorous and engaging prose, Konner sheds light on our biologically different identities, while noting the poignant exceptions that challenge the male/female divide. We meet hunter-gatherers such as those in Botswana, whose culture gave women a prominent place, invented the working mother, and respected women&#x2019;s voices around the fire. Recent human history has upset this balance, as a dense world of war fostered extreme male dominance. But our species has been recovering over the past two centuries, and an unstoppable move toward equality is afoot. It will not be the end of men, but it will be the end of male supremacy and a better, wiser world for women and men alike.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten.

Long are their tales, told around mead halls or the flickering glow of a hungry fire.

The Forrester family are slowly winning their fight for survival. But fourteen-year-old Helen&#39;s personal battle is to persuade her parents to allow her to earn her own living, to lead her own life after the years of neglect and inadequate schooling while she cared for her six younger brothers and sisters. Her untiring struggles against illness caused by severe malnutrition and dirt (she has her first bath in four years) and, above all, the selfish demands of her parents, make this a story of amazing courage and perseverance.</p><p>Helen Forrester was born in Hoylake, Cheshire, the eldest of seven children.

Knights meet in fellowship at Camelot, and are entertained with feasting and pageantry. Honor and chivalry are valued above all else, and courageous knights fight strange, unearthly foes to prove themselves worthy of a place at King Arthur's table.</p> <p>These ancient tales have been told since the fifth century when Welsh bards traveled the country entertaining lords and ladies with stories and songs.

With over 200 annotated high quality black and white illustrations and six full colour plates, printed on fine quality paper, it is a volume for any edged weapon or British Army enthusiast to treasure. The text encompasses technical details such as the pattern of swords, the reasons why certain types were adopted, and instructions for correctly wearing them. There are descriptions of the use of swords in battle, sometimes described by the swordsman wielding them, such as the gory account of the butchery at Waterloo by Sgt. Ewart who famously charged with the Royal Scots Greys. Here, Sir Garnett Wolseley, the celebrated Victorian General, describes chopping men down from head to waist while serving with the Household Cavalry in Egypt in 1882. There are appendices on marking swords and chronological lists of changing sword patterns. This is a Naval and Military Press and National Army Museum joint reprint of the 1996 revised edition of a book that first appeared in 1975 and quickly established itself as the standard authority on the British Army&#39;s swords.</p><p></p><h2>Red and Me: My Coach, My Lifelong Friend</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Bill Russell was the greatest team basketball player ever....[He] has produced a moving tribute to his friend and, in a larger sense, to friendship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<em>Booklist </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Red and Me</em>, Boston Celtics basketball legend Bill Russell pays homage to his mentor and coach, the inimitable Red Auerbach.

Bill Russell, the star center on the Auerbach teams that won eleven championships in thirteen years, said little in public at the time. His relationship with his coach had been so deeply personal that he could not express it with a brief comment.</p><p>Auerbach and Russell&#x2014;one a short, brash Jew from Brooklyn; the other a tall, intense African-American from Louisiana and Oakland&#x2014;were far more than just coach and player. Through thirteen years of building a sports dynasty together, one that remains among the greatest of all time, their relationship evolved into a rare example of deep male friendship: confident, supportive, understanding, founded in common goals, even as their feelings remained largely unspoken.</p><p><em>Red and Me</em> is an extraordinary book: an homage to a peerless coach; an inspiring story of mutual success; and perhaps the best depiction of male friendship ever put on the page.</p><p>Five-time NBA MVP and twelve-time All-Star, Bill Russell was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won eleven NBA championships.

The things Stafford discovers about himself in the process are every bit as gripping as his investigation, and when the two threads of his life come together &#x2013; the results are unforgettable.<br><br> Black Fridays<i> </i>marks the arrival of a remarkable new writer.</p></p><p>Michael Sears spent over twenty years on Wall Street, rising to become a managing director at Paine Webber and Jeffries &amp; Co., before leaving the business in 2005.

Three seconds took her down only fourteen stories&#x2014; she still had twenty- four to go. She fainted. Her arms and legs stopped flailing, her body went limp.</p><p>The few pedestrians on Maiden Lane, forced by circumstance to brave the baking midafternoon sidewalk on the hottest first day of summer in New York City history, all froze at the sound, like grown-up children playing a game of Statues.</p><p>The bicycle messenger, a recent veteran of two tours of duty in Afghanistan, was busy chaining his vehicle to the no parking sign. When he heard the scream, he dove clear across the sidewalk, landing behind a large concrete planter.</p><p>Wind resistance on the woman&#x2019;s skirt, combined with the relative effects of gravity upon the denser mass of her head, spun her so that when she struck the roof of the idling Town Car at more than one hundred miles per hour, she hit headfirst&#x2014;like a bullet. Her heart, unaware that the woman was now legally dead, continued to pump for another few seconds, spewing streams and geysers of blood out of various wounds and orifices.</p><p>Despite some doubts, the investigating team from NYPD found no reason not to treat the situation as a straightforward successful suicide&#x2014;thereby both clearing a case and, with the same stroke of the pen, keeping the murder rate down below the previous year&#x2019;s, a measure of great importance to the mayor&#x2019;s Office of Tourism.</p><p>No one paid much attention to the shaky veteran who told anyone who would listen, &#x201c;When you want to die, you don&#x2019;t scream like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I WAS THE FIRST alumnus from my MBA class to make managing director. I was also the first, as far as I know, to go to prison.</p><p>They make you skip breakfast the day they release you. It&#x2019;s not the final indignity, and far from the worst, but it&#x2019;s such a small thing, so petty, so unnecessary, that it just hammers home one last time, as though you needed another reminder, that in prison you are nothing. Nothing.</p><p>I followed the guards down a short corridor, through a final electrically controlled gate, and into a small room with a metal door, two molded plastic chairs, and a three-inch- thick plexiglass window on the far wall. Through the window I could see my father in the next room, showing his ID and signing his name with a pen that was chained to a clipboard. They probably had to throw the whole thing away whenever they ran out of ink.</p><p>He saw me staring at him and gave a short wave. He had been to visit only a month before, but he looked years older&#x2014;grayer, paler, shorter. I imagined there were more pleasant things to do on a late-summer morning than pick up your only son from prison. My sentence had ended at midnight; that&#x2019;s the way they do it. For two years, time had been marked by lights on, meals, lights off, with random violence the only relief from boredom. The guards&#x2014;polite, almost respectful for the first time&#x2014;had arrived a few minutes early. It didn&#x2019;t matter&#x2014;I hadn&#x2019;t slept.</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck, Jason.&#x201d; My cellmate was awake as well. He had another four months to go on a two-year stint. He was a car wash owner turned tax protester, who had believed some Internet nonsense about income taxes being unconstitutional. So for a pissy hundred grand or so, he had become a guest of the state, learning the hard realities behind constitutional law.</p><p>&#x201c;Take care, Myron. Give me a call sometime.&#x201d;</p><p>I doubted he would. Neither of us would want to remember where we had met.</p><p>There were a few murmured good- byes from the darkened cells as the two guards walked me off the block. Otisville harbored a more congenial, less confrontational clientele than Ray Brook, where I had served the first eighteen months of my sentence. At Otisville, it was possible to play a game of cards that did not lead to getting jumped in the yard the next day. I hadn&#x2019;t exactly made friends there, just acknowledged fellow travelers.</p><p>Two years. Two years earlier, in the midst of a plea bargain meeting, I thought I had misheard. &#x201c;Two years.&#x201d; For an accounting shuffle? Ridiculous. You pay a fine and move on. Time served. That&#x2019;s how these things end up. But the Feds wanted my scalp. It was a half-billion-dollar accounting shuffle, which had come close to bringing down a major investment bank. The stock had plummeted. Investors were outraged. The president&#x2019;s mother-in-law lost almost ten thousand dollars! The Feds needed someone to put in the stocks and get pelted with stones and rotten fruit. I was their man.</p><p>My first stop was Ray Brook. It&#x2019;s about a long home run from the Canadian border, high in the Adirondacks. It&#x2019;s the real deal. Somehow, when you do time for a white-collar crime, you think you&#x2019;re going to spend the days passing around <i>Barron&#x2019;s</i> and discussing your portfolio with like-minded individuals. Work out, grow a beard, and catch up on your reading. It wasn&#x2019;t like that.</p><p>Most of the habituï¿½s were there on drug charges, racketeering, or both. It was an eye-opening master class in Diverse Patterns of Confrontation in Modern Gang Culture. I barely passed. The macho posturing of Wall Street does nothing to prepare you for the moment when a three-hundred- pound Latino man with a dark purple scar running across his throat looks up at you from across the chow hall table and rasps out the words, &#x201c;Hey, <i>baboso.</i> Give me your lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>I rapped twice on the table and offered him the bread and mashed potatoes. Truce.</p><p>In comparison, Otisville was cake. It&#x2019;s no country club, no matter what the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> implied when I was moved there, but the prisoners are all short-timers and less prone to violent solutions to minor disagreements; no one wants to risk getting his sentence extended when he&#x2019;s marking off the last days till he goes home. And the food was better.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Stafford?&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t heard him come in. He was a clerk, not a guard. A little pudgy&#x2014;baby-faced. Happy to have a ten-dollar-an-hour clerical job with full benefits&#x2014;even if it was the night shift at the federal prison camp. I had a sudden flash of panic&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t going to let me leave. There was a mistake and this unlikely boob had been assigned the job of letting me know.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your release expediter. I have some forms to go over with you.&#x201d;</p><p>I sucked in a breath, let it out slowly, then did it again. My pulse rate slowed.</p><p>&#x201c;Will this take long?&#x201d; As though I had an appointment.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do what I can.&#x201d; His voice went up at the end of every sentence, making it a question. I didn&#x2019;t know how much of it I could take. &#x201c;I know you have someone here to pick you up.&#x201d; He nodded toward the window. A guard was steering my father into an office and out of view. &#x201c;I hope to get you out in no time at all.&#x201d;</p><p>He wanted to be nice. He wanted me to be nice, too. I thought of some of the other detainees he must have mustered out. It was a high-stress job. I decided to try to make it easy on him.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you need from me?&#x201d;</p><p>Forms. He explained them in bureaucratic detail. I signed them. He handed me a big padded envelope that held my clothes from the first day I entered the system. Underwear, jeans, and a polo shirt. I signed for them. I signed a release form that said I had been advised of the necessary procedures I would have to take in the event that I wished to protest any violations of my civil rights I may have suffered during my incarceration. I signed a separate form that absolved the Federal Government of all responsibility for any such violations committed by employees and a third form that said there hadn&#x2019;t been any such violations anyway. For such a brutal, stone-cold bureaucracy, the powers in charge were pretty sensitive about covering their asses.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, then. You can get changed now. I&#x2019;ll be back to get you in a while.&#x201d;</p><p>The clothes didn&#x2019;t fit. My waist and hips were slimmer, my chest and shoulders broader. At the ancient age of forty-four, for the first time in my life I had pecs.</p><p>&#x201c;In a while&#x201d; was still on prison time. No one was rushing to speed my way home. My father was still hidden in the office. I sat down, propped my feet on the other chair, and tried to imagine life on the outside.</p><p>No man ever admits to having been asleep, but I had dreamed. Dreams of pain and torture. My body was on a rack, and each click of the wheel shot sharp spasms along my spine.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck!&#x201d; I staggered upright and stretched. I had felt much younger going into prison than I did coming out. Outside, two years is an episode&#x2014;inside, an eternity.</p><p>My stomach was telling me it was six, maybe seven. I thought about the hamburger at the 21 Club. Actually, any hamburger would do. And a cold beer.</p><p>The door slammed back against the wall.</p><p>&#x201c;Stafford!&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t the clerk; it was a dull-eyed dayshift guard. That meant it was already after eight. &#x201c;This way.&#x201d; He stepped back and waved me out ahead of him, looking me over as though he expected to find I&#x2019;d stolen a chair and hidden it down my pants.</p><p>He swung the final door open and I felt like I was taking my first full breath in two years.</p><p>My father wrapped his arms around me and while I wanted to pull away, it just felt too good. I let him go on hugging me until he pulled away in damp-eyed embarrassment.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, son.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked him in the eye; I owed him that. &#x201c;Hey, Pop.&#x201d; There was too much to say&#x2014; regrets, recriminations, disappointments&#x2014;so we did what we always did. We said none of it.</p><p>It was raining and windy. The tail end of summer was giving way to fall all too quickly. The chill came right through the light nylon jacket he had brought for me. The collar smelled of his Viceroy cigarettes, though he hadn&#x2019;t smoked in years&#x2014;not since my mother died. The coat must have come from far back in his closet. We climbed into his near-classic Olds 88 and headed home.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you might want to spend a night or two with me. Until you can get the apartment together.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a bad jolt. Prison shrinks your brain. I had thought about food and sex and taking my son to a Yankees game and the smell of the ocean and what it would be like to sleep in a room with an unlocked door. But I&#x2019;d managed to hide from all the big questions.</p><p>My marriage. Work. The nuts and bolts of basic survival. A future. All the things I hadn&#x2019;t thought about began screaming for attention. I felt a surge of claustrophobia.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Pop, but no,&#x201d; I finally managed. &#x201c;Give me a day or two. I&#x2019;ll come over for dinner some night.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t up to explaining that after two years of no privacy whatsoever, I just wanted to be alone. For at least one night.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been aging a nice pair of prime steaks. Some fresh asparagus. A Caesar salad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. Sounds great. Friday night?&#x201d; The prison stench was still in my nostrils, turning my stomach every time I inhaled. I tried breathing in through my mouth, out the nose. The smell faded.</p><p>He held back a sigh. &#x201c;Friday night it is, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for understanding,&#x201d; I said, though I knew he didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;I brought you a black-and-white.&#x201d; He handed me a white paper bag. &#x201c;From Carla&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>Carla&#x2019;s black-and-white cookies had been my unfailing cure for the blues. When I was ten. &#x201c;Thanks, Pop. Maybe later.&#x201d; I was hungry enough, but I was afraid I&#x2019;d start bawling if I ate it.</p><p>&#x201c;So, I thought we&#x2019;d take 84 over to Milford and then 206/15 down to 80. It&#x2019;s a pretty drive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nyah. You want 17 to 87 and over the Tappan Zee,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hate the Tappan Zee. How about the other way on 84&#x2014;all the way to Brewster and then down the Hutch.&#x201d;</p><p>He was comforting me with his own obsessions. My father could debate four different ways of going down to the 7-Eleven for a pint of half- and-half on a Sunday morning. Around the time I started growing pubic hair, it started making me crazy. Then in college I found myself doing it. Later, I found it made my wife nuts. That&#x2019;s not fair. My wife was more than a bit nuts when I met her.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I want? I want to see New York from the GW Bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your day.&#x201d;</p><p>We rode in silence for a while.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to play something on the radio? You go ahead.&#x201d; This was a hugely magnanimous gesture. Not only was he tone-deaf&#x2014;he loved to repeat the old line &#x201c;I only know two songs. One of them&#x2019;s &#x2018;Happy Birthday.&#x2019; The other isn&#x2019;t&#x201d;&#x2014;but he also had, what I considered to be, an unhealthy addiction to sports talk radio.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Pop. I&#x2019;m enjoying the quiet.&#x201d;</p><p>The quiet didn&#x2019;t last long.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard from Angie at all?&#x201d;</p><p>Angie was my wife. Ex-wife. We met at a Bear Stearns party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She and two hundred other models had been hired to circulate at the party and &#x201c;add color.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m sure that it was the first time she had ever been there. I was an adult version of a nerd, a Wall Street trader, and a multimillionaire. Angie was an underwear model with a charming, bubbling ditziness&#x2014;think Myrna Loy in a D-cup&#x2014;that disguised all clues to her dark side. She was also a monumental narcissist, a street fighter, and&#x2014;I discovered later&#x2014;a lush. But she was never boring. We were both asked to leave that party after Angie convinced me to go wading with her in the fountain at the Temple of Dendur. For the first time in eight years, I called in sick the next day. And I stayed in bed all day&#x2014;her bed. We were married eight weeks later. I thought I knew what I was doing.</p><p>&#x201c;Idiot!&#x201d; Pop said, as an SUV swerved into our lane without signaling. The car behind us flashed its brights in protest.</p><p>I let him ask the question again.</p><p>&#x201c;So, I was saying . . . heard from Angie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I finally answered. &#x201c;Not since they left.&#x201d;</p><p>It had been almost eight months. At first she made regular once-a-month trips up to Ray Brook. I grew to resent how dependent I became upon those visits. They brought no pleasure&#x2014;divorced men get no conjugal visits&#x2014;only desire, pain, frustration, and anger.</p><p>But they were all I had. I never thought they must have been tough for her as well.</p><p>She sent me a card announcing the move. Gilt lettering on heavy linen stock, like a wedding invitation. &#x201c;Angie and Jason Jr. are leaving New York and heading home. Y&#x2019;all come see us sometime.&#x201d; Underneath was her mother&#x2019;s address in Beauville, Louisiana. There was no signature. I suppose I should have been gratified that I was on the distribution list.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go see her,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We can straighten this all out.&#x201d; I might have believed it, too.</p><p>My father made that little noncommittal grunt that manages to express nonbelief in the most nonconfrontational manner and we lapsed back into silence.</p><p>The traffic was starting to get to me. They all drove too fast. The trucks and SUVs all looked impossibly large and the way everyone careened from lane to lane with only limited regard for human life&#x2014; their own or anyone else&#x2019;s&#x2014;gave me a headache. I put my head back and closed my eyes.</p><p>A few minutes later, I felt my father&#x2019;s hand cover mine. He gave a gentle squeeze.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep the faith, bud. Fresh start. It&#x2019;s all going to work out.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t tell him about the big trucks and the headache. I just squeezed his hand back. Maybe he was right.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Pop.&#x201d; I nodded off for a bit.</p><p>The rain tapered off, leaving a thick fog. I couldn&#x2019;t see shit from the GW Bridge. If New York City was throwing a party for my return, it was well hidden.</p><p>THE FIRST STEP had been just a mistake. An error. I put the wrong date on a trade ticket and the computer, rather than catching it and spitting it back to our clerk, assigned the trade to the following year.</p><p>In this case, changing the settlement date gave a huge boost to the plus column for the day&#x2019;s trading.

A cat who liked to go fishing and sit on the bow of the old man&#x2019;s boat, her face into the wind, like she was a hood ornament. "Fool cat," the old man would say. "You ain&#x2019;t nobody&#x2019;s prize." Then one day something unexpected happens, and they both learn that even the most cantankerous love can inspire acts of heroic proportions - but not, of course, so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice.</p><p>Terry Farish is the author of several young adult novels. She says of THE CAT WHO LIKED POTATO SOUP, "This story began in the kitchen of our old-timer neighbor, Jimmy Fowler. My daughter and I were visiting with him there, gossiping about some village cat or other. Jimmy didn&#x2019;t have a cat, but he said if we got one, wouldn&#x2019;t we name it after him? And we did . We got a cat and named her Jimmy."<br>Barry Root is the illustrator of many books for children. He says, "I&#x2019;ve always been pro-cat, although our house is divided on the subject. To appreciate a cat requires a certain amount of abstraction, I think - and a sense of humor." Barry Root lives in rural Pennsylvania with his wife (the illustrator Kimberly Bulcken Root), their three children, and a couple of useless dogs.PreSchool-Grade 3-A curmudgeonly old man and a standoffish cat share potato soup, an electric blanket, and regular fishing trips near their small, comfortable home. When the cat gets tired and the man goes fishing without her, the insulted feline disappears. She howls out the story of her ocean adventure when she returns, and the two reconcile contentedly. The simple tale sparkles with warmth and good humor, thanks to the casual storyteller's voice that carries the narrative. The man liked the cat, "but not so's you'd notice," and "The cat was fond of the man's potato soup, which made him love her a breath more-." Their true feelings are reflected in the watercolor-and-gouache paintings. An early illustration shows the man happily preparing soup with the cat looking on attentively, if not eagerly. This contrasts subtly to a later scene in which the man dines alone, with eyes up as if his lost pet might return at any minute. The prickly relationship between the human and the animal rings true, along with a broader message of friendship. By the time the two are reconciled, readers feel like they know this pair pretty well, more by how they act than by anything they say. The carefully chosen words and charming simplicity of the illustrations lead to an unsentimental, but very satisfying tale of companionship.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Storyworld</h2><p>&#34;Have you ever wanted to tell a story, but not know how to begin?

Hammond and Christina Scull examine Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece chapter by chapter, offering expert insights into its evolution, structure, and meaning. They discuss in close detail important literary and historical influences on the development of The Lord of the Rings, connections between that work and other writings by Tolkien, errors and inconsistencies, significant changes to the text during its fifty years of publication, archaic and unusual words used by Tolkien, and words and passages in his invented languages of Middle-earth. Thousands of notes, keyed to standard editions of The Lord of the Rings but universally accessible, reveal the richness and complexity of one of the most popular works of fiction in our time. In addition to their own expertise and that of other scholars and critics, Hammond and Scull frequently draw upon comments by Tolkien himself, made in letters to family, friends, and enthusiasts, in draft texts of The Lord of the Rings, and in works written in later years which amplify or illuminate characters and events in the story. Extensive reference is made also to writings by Tolkien not previously or widely published, including elaborate time-schemes, an unfinished manuscript index to The Lord of the Rings, and most notably, the important Nomenclature or guide to names in The Lord of the Rings prepared for the use of translators, long out of print and now newly transcribed and printed in its entirety. With these resources at hand, even the most seasoned reader of The Lord of the Rings will come to a greater enjoyment and appreciation of Tolkien&#39;s magnificent achievement.</p><p>WAYNE G.

It is also expanded to contain discussions of 100 more chateaux and tasting notes for 1,000 more wines.

Because wine, especially Bordeaux, changes as it matures, the new notes are a welcome aid to connoisseurs.

Reissue. <i>NYT. </i></p><p>DeceasedArchie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe take on murder by poisoned champagne. The case presents challenges. Michael Pritchard's resolute and somewhat wry narration is perfectly suited to both the characters and the setting--New York in the 1950s. Wolfe's superiority is captured perfectly, and Prichard is quite believable when reading the women in the story. He also shines as Archie, giving voice to his world-weariness and his resolve that the murderer will be identified. The listener can empathize with both his frustration at having to put up with Wolfe and his admiration for his employer. A solid story, with solid narration.

Shy, lovely Lily Walsh leaves her rural homeland, the tiny Asian country of Kashien, to visit her brother Jeff in Hawaii. Everything is new and exciting to Lily: grocery stores that overflow with food, chewing gum, coffee makers, and the luxury of hot showers. Most thrilling of all is Jeff's best friend, the handsome Hawaiian Gabriel Kapaia, who teaches her how to play tennis and golf, and encourages her to become more assertive. Despite her conservative father's disapproval, Lily falls in love with Gabe and must choose between pleasing a parent and following the tug of her heart. Although the book loses a little steam toward the end, <i>Bamboo and Lace</i> is a solid contribution to the Christian romance genre, and should win Wick some new readers and as well as satisfy her legion of fans. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><p><b>Lori Wick</b> is a multifaceted author of Christian fiction.

His one hope is Ava Lee&#x2015;sleek, capable forensic accountant and sleuth. With the help of her Triad-connected partner, Uncle, Ava follows the money trail from San Francisco to Costa Rica to the casinos and illegal gambling dens of Las Vegas. Meanwhile, a vengeful adversary from Ava's past has put out a contract on her life, and the shadowy hit man is close at her heels every step of the way. Will Ava recover the stolen cash without stepping into the crosshairs of a growing list of enemies? The first book of an electrifying new series, Ian Hamilton's <i>The Disciple of Las Vegas </i>introduces Ava Lee: a deadly martial artist with a taste for luxury and a mind like a steel trap.</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Hamilton</b> has had a range of careers over the span of his life, from journalist to diplomat, but it wasn't until a health scare that he sat down to write his first novel. Ava Lee was the heroine that came to him and so the series was born. Hamilton's journalism has been featured in <i>Maclean's</i> and <i>Saturday Night</i> <i>Magazine.</i> He is the author of <i>The Disciple of Las Vegas</i>, <i>The Wild Beasts of Wuhan</i>, <i>The Red Pole of Macau</i>, and <i>The Water Rat of Wanchai</i>. He lives in Burlington, Ontario, with his wife, Lorraine. He has four children and seven grandchildren.</p>(1) <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>When Ava Lee woke up, the first thing she felt was a sharp pain shooting through her neck and shoulder. She stretched, causing the pain to become more intense, and then slowly relaxed her muscles. She knew from experience that the lashing she had endured wasn&#x2019;t going to cause any long-term damage. <br>She turned her head to look at the bedside clock. It was only 6 a.m. She had flown home to Toronto around midnight and had been in bed for less than five hours. She had thought that two melatonin capsules and a glass of Pinot Grigio would see her through the night, but the pain and a mind that was still a jumble of emotions were gnawing at her. <br>She lay quietly, hoping she could drift off again. After ten minutes she gave up and pulled herself out of bed. She kneeled to say a short prayer of thanks to St. Jude for her safe return, and then headed for the bathroom. Pulling off her black Giordano T-shirt, Ava turned so she could see her back in the mirror. The belt had hit her on the side of the neck and across her right shoulder, and then again on the same shoulder and partway down her back. The marks were a deep black and blue, yellowed at the edges. They looked worse than they felt, and in a few days they would start to fade. <br>Ava went into the kitchen, made herself a Starbucks VIA Ready Brew, and sat down at the small round table set against the window overlooking Cumberland Street and Avenue Road. She lived in the heart of Yorkville, the ritziest neighbourhood in downtown Toronto. Despite the early hour, the traffic below was barely moving as the January weather tried to decide if it was raining or snowing. <br>Normally she would have the <i>Globe and Mail</i> spread across the table, but she had been away for more than a week&nbsp;&#x2014; travelling to Hong Kong, Thailand, Guyana, and the British Virgin Islands, tracking down and retrieving more than five million dollars that had been stolen from a client&nbsp;&#x2014; and had cancelled the paper until further notice. So she opened up her laptop and turned it on to read the news online. That was a mistake. <br>After she signed on, Ava opened her email program, expecting to see messages from friends, a bit of spam, and not much else. She froze when she saw Uncle&#x2019;s name in her inbox. Uncle was her Hong Kong&#x2013;based partner, a man in his seventies whose idea of high-tech communication was a Chinese knockoff iPhone he had bought for less than forty dollars at the Kowloon nighttime street market and used strictly for making calls. He had sent her two messages in the past eight hours; she couldn&#x2019;t remember receiving that many from him in the past year. She opened them. They were identical, simply stating that he needed her to call him. He didn&#x2019;t say it was urgent. He didn&#x2019;t have to&nbsp;&#x2014; that he had sent two emails conveyed that fact well enough. <br>Ava groaned, went over to her hot-water Thermos, and made another coffee. She knew what he wanted to talk about. While she was in Guyana they had been offered a job by a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Tommy Ordonez. Ordonez was the wealthiest man in the islands. They had put him off so they could finish the job they were on. Ava had hoped he could be put off longer, because that job had turned nasty, with unforeseen complications. What was supposed to have been a straightforward tracking and retrieval of misappropriated funds had turned into extortion. She had prevailed, but not without difficulty, as the bruises and welts demonstrated, and not without stress, some of which still lingered. <br>Ava had turned off her cellphone the night before and thrown it into the bottom of her purse. She had intended to leave it there for a few days, or at least until she felt her head was in the right place. She went to retrieve it and saw that Uncle had called as well. She sighed. She had to call him back. She couldn&#x2019;t ignore two emails and a phone message without insulting him. Insulting Uncle was something she had never done&nbsp;&#x2014; and never wished to do. It was just past six in the evening in Hong Kong, and Ava knew she&#x2019;d probably catch him at a massage, an early dinner, or his Kowloon apartment. <br>&#x201c; <i>Wei</i>,&#x201d; Uncle said. Ava could hear his little dog yapping and his Filipina housekeeper, Lourdes, telling it to be quiet. He was still at the apartment. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ava.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You are in Toronto?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, I got in late last night.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you are okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good, I was worried about you&nbsp;&#x2026; It is early there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, and then I turned on my computer and saw your emails.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We need to talk.&#x201d; <br>Ava wondered if he thought she was being critical of his persistence, and she felt a bit uneasy about being perceived as even mildly rude. &#x201c;No problem, Uncle. Is it about Tommy Ordonez?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. He and his closest adviser, Chang Wang, each called me twice yesterday, after calling me twice the day before. I have been telling them they need to be patient.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And how did they react?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Impatiently.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Uncle, you did tell them we never do two jobs at the same time, and that I was still working on one?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course, but it only seemed to frustrate them more. Especially Ordonez. He is a man who does not think he should ever have to stand in a queue or have someone else&#x2019;s interests take precedence over his.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did he say that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t need to. Ava, the last time I spoke to him he could barely contain himself. I could feel him eating his anger, and I know that if he had been talking to anyone but me he would have exploded.&#x201d; <br>Ava finished her second coffee and, holding the phone to her ear, went to the counter and emptied another sachet into her cup. &#x201c;What do we know about the job, Uncle?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not that much. Just that it is a lot of money, that it involves a Canadian real estate transaction, and that one of Ordonez&#x2019;s younger brothers, Philip Chew, is involved. They want to meet us face to face to provide the actual details.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it a firm contract?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If we want to accept it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t committed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought it would be best for us to hear the full story before signing on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t understand, Uncle, is why, with all the resources and power they have, they need us in the first place.&#x201d; <br>She had asked that question when the job offer was first made, and it had generated an awkward response from Uncle. Now he was just vague. &#x201c;They will explain everything when we are in Manila.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So you want us to go?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told Chang Wang that we would discuss it with them, and they are insisting on doing that in person&nbsp;&#x2026; I am told the sum of money involved is more than fifty million dollars. I think that is worth a trip to Manila, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course it is,&#x201d; she said, and then realized that Uncle had twice referred to Ordonez&#x2019;s right-hand man by both his family and given names. It was a form of respect he rarely used for clients, and she guessed there was some kind of bond between the two men. &#x201c;This Chang, Uncle, do you know him well?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He is from Wuhan, like me, and over the years we have done each other many favours. I would still have ten men rotting in Filipino prisons if it were not for him, and he would still be waiting for permits to build cigarette factories in Hubei province if it were not for me.&#x201d; <br>Ava was accustomed to Uncle&#x2019;s Wuhan connections. He had been born and raised in a village on its outskirts, and he and the other men from there who had escaped the Communist regime had remained intensely loyal to each other. &#x201c;And Chang hasn&#x2019;t confided in you about the nature of Ordonez&#x2019;s problem?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;His first loyalty is to Ordonez. We need to understand and respect that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Earlier you mentioned that Ordonez was restraining himself when he was talking to you. I didn&#x2019;t think you knew him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chang introduced us once, years ago, when I was at the top of my heap and he was scaling his. It was a passing encounter that seems more important to him than it is to me. I did not even remember the meeting until he mentioned it.&#x201d; <br>Ava was now standing by the kitchen window. The falling rain was beginning to freeze onto it. She watched a car skid into the intersection below and slide into an SUV. She hated this kind of weather. At least Manila would be warm. &#x201c;Can you buy us an extra day or two?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Uncle hesitated. She knew he didn&#x2019;t want to push her too hard. &#x201c;I would like to get there as soon as possible. But if you need to spend more time in Toronto, then I will deal with Chang Wang and Ordonez as best as I can.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Will they walk away from the deal if we delay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I guess that&#x2019;s something we shouldn&#x2019;t risk,&#x201d; Ava said. <br>&#x201c;No, we should not. Their impatience could get the better of them.&#x201d; <br>She did a quick calculation. &#x201c;If I catch the Cathay Pacific flight late tonight, I can be in Hong Kong the day after tomorrow, early morning, your time. That at least will give me all of today to get caught up here, and I&#x2019;ll have a sixteen-hour flight I can sleep through.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. We can leave for Manila the morning you arrive. I will have those flights booked. We can meet in the Wing lounge,&#x201d; Uncle said. &#x201c;I will let Chang Wang know right away that we are coming. Ordonez&#x2019;s office is near the Ayala Centre in Makati City. The Peninsula Hotel is nearby. I will have them book us rooms.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll call you when things are confirmed on this end.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fine. And Ava, I think this is the right thing for us to do.&#x201d; <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;Ordonez is a big man and it&#x2019;s a lot of money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That does not mean we cannot still say no,&#x201d; Uncle said. &#x201c;We will go and talk to them, and then you and I can discuss what we want to do. I have to tell you, I have a feeling that it will be worth it in the end.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Uncle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Now I have to call Chang,&#x201d; he said. <br>As she hung up the phone, Ava tried to remember if she&#x2019;d heard Uncle mention Chang&#x2019;s name before, and came up blank. That wasn&#x2019;t unusual. He had a network of friends and associates that spanned Asia, though his closest contacts were those who shared those long, deep Wuhan roots. <br> <i>Is Ordonez from Wuhan as well?</i> she wondered. She knew he was Chinese born, but nothing more specific than that. She&#x2019;d find out soon enough, but her curiosity was far more aroused by the kind of problem a man as rich and powerful as Tommy Ordonez couldn&#x2019;t handle himself. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright ï¿½ 2011 by Ian Hamilton <br></p><h2>The Boy Who Knew Everything (Piper McCloud, 2)</h2><p><p>Conrad Harrington III doesn&#x2019;t want to be a super genius; he just wants to live a normal life.

Victoria lives in Pasadena, California, with her husband and their daughter.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;The long-awaited follow-up to The Girl Who Could Fly (Feiwel &amp; Friends, 2008) finds Piper ("the girl who could fly") and Conrad ("the boy who knew everything") living in relative calm on Piper's family farm. Some time has passed since they and their fellow exceptional children escaped Dr. Hellion's prison of a school, yet the calm lasts only briefly as a few disparate events quickly unfold and turn everything upside down. In quick succession, the near death of Piper's beloved father, his father's election to the presidency, and a successful experiment in time-bending spurs Conrad to finally step up as leader of their band of misfit children. Under Conrad's tutelage, the kids carry out anonymous goodwill missions in response to fishy "natural" disasters. Yet their mission proves far from straightforward. Who is behind these disasters? Is there indeed a secret place where exceptional kids are free to be themselves? As in its predecessor, this installment straddles the real and the imagined. At times, this blend coalesces beautifully, but often it proves a bit clunky. The folksy colloquialisms uttered by Piper and her parents still feel out of place, leaving readers a little unsettled as to the setting. Its greatest strength emerges when the tale balances quiet moments of self-realization, identity, and friendship with an action-packed plot.

What impact has their division had on Western culture? Historian Christopher Dawson answers these and other important questions in his classic study,&nbsp;<i>The Dividing of Christendom</i>. Based on Dawson's Harvard lectures, this book provides a highly readable, masterful overview of the factors that led to one of the deepest divides in Western history&#x2015;one that endures and gave momentum to social, cultural and political changes whose consequences are still with us. The decline of medieval unity, the Renaissance, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the cultures of divided Christendom, the rise of modern secular culture, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution are all presented in an engagingly, popular style.</p><p>This is a work for all Western Christians who want to understand the historical origins of their present divisions and possible ways of overcoming them. Dawson writes, "Of all divisions between Christians, that between Catholics and Protestants is the deepest and the most pregnant in its historical consequences. It is so deep that we cannot see any solution to it in the present period and under existing historical circumstances. But at least it is possible for us to take the first step by attempting to overcome the enormous gap in mutual understanding which has hitherto rendered any intellectual contact or collaboration impossible."</p><p>Ecumenism progressed significantly after Dawson penned those words, especially following the Second Vatican Council, but the problem of Christian disunity persists. This is a fitting subject for Christopher Dawson, whose genius was to present the broad sweep of history with verve, clarity, insight and authority. Only a deep appreciation of how the present Christian divisions arose, Dawson argues in&nbsp;<i>The Dividing of Christendom</i>, will permit an authentic return to full Christian unity.</p></p><p></p><h2>Overlord: The D-Day Landings</h2><p>Operation Overlord was the largest amphibious military operation ever launched, with a vast armada transporting over 150,000 Allied soldiers across the Channel. Just after dawn on 6 June 1944, the Allied troops assaulted the beaches of the Cotentin peninsula against stiff German resistance. Coordinated with the amphibious landings were a number of aerial assaults that carried out crucial missions to take key areas, enable the vital link up between the beaches. Casualties sustained by some units during the invasion were horrendous, but the assaults were successful.

His works are translated into thirty-eight languages. He lives in Virginia and Mississippi.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p>Theodore Boone woke up in a foul mood. In fact, he&#x2019;d gone to bed in a foul mood, and things had not improved during the night. As a few rays of morning sun lit his room, he stared at the ceiling and tried to think of ways to avoid this entire week. Generally, he enjoyed school&#x2014;his friends, the teachers, most of the classes, debating&#x2014;but there were times when he just wanted to stay in bed. This was one of those times, the worst week of the year. Beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, and running through Friday, he and every other eighth grader would be stuck at their desks taking a series of dreadful tests.</p><p>Judge knew something was wrong, and at some point had left his spot beside Theo&#x2019;s bed and assumed his spot on top of the covers. Mrs. Boone frowned on the idea of the dog sleeping in Theo&#x2019;s bed, but she was downstairs having her quiet time with the morning newspaper and wouldn&#x2019;t know. Or would she? Occasionally she noticed dog hair on the covers and asked Theo if Judge was sleeping with him. Most of the time Theo said yes, but quickly followed the admission with the question: &#x201c;What am I supposed to do?&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t watch the dog while he, Theo, was sound asleep. And, to be honest, Theo didn&#x2019;t really want the dog in the bed with him. Judge had the irritating habit of stretching himself out smack in the middle of things and expecting Theo to retreat to the edges, where he often came within inches of crashing to the floor and waking up with a sore head. No, Theo preferred that Judge sleep on his little doggy bed down below.</p><p>The truth was, Judge did whatever he wanted to do, and not only in Theo&#x2019;s room but in every room in the house.</p><p>On days like today, Theo envied his dog. What a life: no school, no homework, no tests, no pressure. He ate whenever he wanted, napped most of the day at the office, and seemed unconcerned about most things. The Boones took care of his needs, and he did anything he wanted.</p><p>Reluctantly, Theo got out of bed, rubbed his dog&#x2019;s head, said good morning, but not with as much enthusiasm as usual,and went to the bathroom. Last week the orthodontist had readjusted his braces, and his jaws still ached. He grinned at himself in the mirror, took stock of the mouthful of metal that he despised, and tried to find hope in the fact that he might get the braces off just in time to start the ninth grade.</p><p>He stepped into the shower and thought about the ninth grade. High school. He just wasn&#x2019;t ready for it. He was thirteen and quite content at Strattenburg Middle School, where he liked his teachers, most of them anyway, and was captain of the Debate Team, almost an Eagle Scout and, well, thought of himself as a leader. He was certainly the only kid lawyer in the school, the only kid he knew of who dreamed of being either a big-time trial lawyer or a brilliant young judge. He couldn&#x2019;t make up his mind. In the ninth grade he would be just another lowly freshman at the bottom of the pile. Freshmen got no respect in high school. Middle school was okay because Theo had found his place, a place that would disappear in a few months. High school was all about football, basketball, cheerleaders, driving, dating, band, theatre, large classes, clothes, shaving, and, well, growing up. He just wasn&#x2019;t ready for it. Most of his friends wanted to hurry along and grow up, but not Theo.</p><p>He stepped out of the shower and dried off. Judge was watching him and thinking about nothing but breakfast. Such a lucky dog.</p><p>As Theo brushed his teeth, or rather cleaned his braces, he admitted that life was changing. High school was slowly rising on the horizon. One of its most important and unpleasant warning signs was standardized testing, a horrible idea cooked up by some experts far away. Those people had decided that it was important to give the same tests at the same time to every eighth grader in the state so that the folks in charge of Strattenburg Middle School and all the other schools would know how they stacked up. That was one reason for the tests. Another reason, at least in Strattenburg, was to separate the eighth graders into three groups for high school. The smartest would be fast-tracked into an Honors program. The weaker students would be placed on a slower track.And the average kids would be treated normally and allowed to enjoy high school without special treatment.</p><p>Yet another reason for the tests was to measure how well the teachers were doing. If a teacher&#x2019;s class did really well, he or she would qualify for a bonus. And if the class did poorly, all kinds of bad things might happen to the teacher. He or she might even be fired.</p><p>Needless to say, the entire process of testing, scoring, tracking, and evaluating teachers had become hotly controversial. The students, of course, hated it. Most of the teachers didn&#x2019;t like it. Almost all parents wanted their kids in the Honors classes, and almost all were disappointed. Those with kids on the &#x201c;slow track&#x201d; were mad, even embarrassed.</p><p>And so the debate raged. Mrs. Boone was firmly opposed to the testing, so, of course, Mr. Boone supported it. The family had talked about testing for weeks, over dinner and in the car, and even while watching television. For a month, the eighth-grade teachers had been preparing the students for the tests. &#x201c;Teaching to the tests,&#x201d; was the favorite description, which meant no creative teaching was being done and no one was having fun in class.</p><p>Theo was already sick of the tests, and they had not even started.</p><p>He dressed, grabbed his backpack, and went downstairs, Judge at his heels. He said hello to his mother, who, as always, was curled up on the sofa in her robe, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper. Mr. Boone always left early and joined his friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown diner.</p><p>Theo fixed two bowls of Cheerios and put one on the floor for Judge. They almost always ate in silence, but occasionally Mrs. Boone joined them for a chat. She did this when she suspected something was bothering Theo. Today, she entered the kitchen, poured more coffee, and took a seat across from her son. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up today?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;More reviewing, more practicing how to take the tests.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you nervous?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really. I&#x2019;m just tired already. I don&#x2019;t do well on these tests, so I don&#x2019;t like them.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. Theo was almost a straight-A student, with an occasional B in the sciences, but he had never done well on standardized tests. &#x201c;What if I don&#x2019;t make the Honors track next year?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Teddy, you&#x2019;re going to excel in high school, college, and law school, if you choose to go there. Don&#x2019;t worry about where they put you in the ninth grade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d; Her words felt good in spite of the fact that she called him &#x201c;Teddy,&#x201d; a little nickname that, thankfully, only she used, and only when they were alone.</p><p>Theo had friends whose parents were turning flips and losing sleep over the tests. If their kids didn&#x2019;t make Honors, the parents were convinced their kids were headed for miserable lives. The whole thing seemed silly to Theo.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;I suppose you know that there is a backlash across the country against these tests. They are becoming very unpopular, and there appears to be widespread cheating.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you cheat on a standardized test?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure, but I&#x2019;ve read about some of the cheating. In one district the teachers changed answers. Hard to believe, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would a teacher do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, in that case, the school was not very good and on probation with the district. Plus, the teachers wanted to qualify for a bonus. None of it makes any sense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m getting sick. Do I look pale?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Teddy. You look perfectly healthy.&#x201d;</p><p>It was eight o&#x2019;clock, time to move. Theo rinsed both bowls and left them in the sink, same as always. He kissed his mom on the cheek and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have lunch money?&#x201d; she asked, the same question five days a week.</p><p>&#x201c;Always.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your homework is complete?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll see you when?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop by the office after school.&#x201d; Theo stopped by the office every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And remember to smile.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m smiling, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Love you, Teddy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Love you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Theo stepped outside and said good-bye to Judge, who would ride in the car with Mrs. Boone to the office where he would spend his day sleeping and eating and worrying about nothing. Theo jumped on his bike and sped away, once again wishing he could be a dog for the next four days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>At 8:40 the bell rang and Mr. Mount called his troops to order. Usually, on Mondays, they were fairly rowdy and gabbing nonstop over whatever happened during the weekend. Today, though, they were more subdued. The truth was that everyone in the eighth grade, from the kids to the teachers to the administrators, maybe even the secretaries and janitors, was dreading the week to come.</p><p>Woody raised his hand and said, &#x201c;Say, Mr. Mount, I have an idea. Since I don&#x2019;t want to be on the Honors track, and since I&#x2019;m far too smart for the slow track, why can&#x2019;t I just take a pass and be normal and skip all these tests?&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Mount smiled and said, &#x201c;Because the school says you have to take the tests. It&#x2019;s one way of making sure our school is doing well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our school is in the top ten percent in the state, or at least that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re told all the time around here,&#x201d; Woody replied. &#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;re doing well. We have great teachers, brilliant students, the works.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. Look, guys, I&#x2019;m not crazy about these tests myself, but I&#x2019;m not making the rules.&#x201d;</p><p>Woody was on a roll. &#x201c;Okay, but just look around the room. We know that Chase and Joey and Aaron and maybe Theo will score high and make Honors. We also know that the slow ones&#x2014;Justin and Darren and, of course, Edward&#x2014;will end up in the slow group. Why can&#x2019;t the rest of us just admit that we&#x2019;re normal and skip the tests?&#x201d;</p><p>Amid the hissing, Edward said, &#x201c;Speak for yourself, you idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My IQ is much higher than yours,&#x201d; Darren shot from across the room.</p><p>&#x201c;You almost flunked phys ed,&#x201d; Justin yelled from the back.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; Mr. Mount said, holding up both hands. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough for now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to puke,&#x201d; Woody said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really getting sick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Knock it off. First period will be with Ms. Garman to review math. Next will be language arts with Ms. Eberlee, then a fifteen-minute break. I know you guys are excited. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p>They moaned and groaned and trudged out of the room, as if headed for a firing squad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After three hours of torture, the students were especially happy to gather in the cafeteria for a thirty-minute lunch break. Theo wanted to get away from the boys and happened to see April Finnemore sitting alone. He took his tray of spaghetti and salad and eased into the chair next to her. &#x201c;Having any fun?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Theo,&#x201d; she said quietly. They were close friends, nothing romantic or anything like that, though Woody and the others often teased Theo about his weird girlfriend. April was different, not weird. She was serious, often moody, and often misunderstood by her classmates. She dressed more like a boy than a girl, wore her hair very short, and had no interest in fashion and teen gossip and social media and all the other stuff she deemed trivial. She loved art and wanted to be a painter, in Paris or Santa Fe, somewhere far from home because home was not a happy place. Her parents were nuts. Her older brother and sister had already fled. She was often alone and left to fend for herself.</p><p>Theo was about the only kid in the eighth grade who tried to understand her. &#x201c;Are you as bored as I am?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Totally. I can&#x2019;t wait until Friday afternoon and these tests are behind us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you nervous?&#x201d; he asked as he shoveled in a load of spaghetti.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, very. I have to make the Honors track, Theo, because it offers more art programs. I don&#x2019;t care about anything else. The art classes are small, and the best teachers are in Honors.&#x201d; She spoke softly as she pushed some salad around her plate. She had the appetite of a bird. She hadn&#x2019;t touched her roll, and Theo had his eye on it.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do fine, April. You could make straight A&#x2019;s if you wanted to.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t, because neither parent pushed her at home. She was absent more than any other student, and when she was in class she was often unprepared. She made perfect grades in French and Spanish but was uninterested in everything else. Except art.</p><p>&#x201c;How are things at home?&#x201d; he asked, glancing around. It was a loaded question because the answer could be anything. The Finnemores lived in a rental house in a lesser part of town, and April kept her other friends away from the house. But Theo understood.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I guess. About the same. I just stay in my room, do art, and read books.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad things are okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Theo. You&#x2019;re going to do fine on the tests.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you do. You&#x2019;re a good student and you&#x2019;re competitive. You want to be at the top of every class, including law school. Don&#x2019;t tell me you don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, maybe a little. But law school seems like a long way off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is. Let&#x2019;s get through high school first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deal.&#x201d;</p><p>A boy named Pete approached them from the other side of the cafeteria and looked as if he wanted to say something. He was an eighth grader from another section, a kid Theo hardly knew. His hands were empty; he had no lunch tray, no brown bag. Slowly, he sat down and glanced nervously at April, then at Theo. &#x201c;Hi, Pete,&#x201d; Theo said.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I talk to you?&#x201d; he said timidly, as if April had suddenly vanished.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, sure. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we talk, just the two of us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just finishing up here,&#x201d; April said as she grabbed her tray and stood. &#x201c;See you later, Theo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Pete said after she was gone. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to interrupt.&#x201d;</p><p>Well, you sure did a fine job of it, Theo thought, but said nothing. The kid had a bruise on his cheek and looked frightened. &#x201c;Can we go outside?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you eaten?&#x201d; Theo asked.</p><p>He nodded slightly, as if he wasn&#x2019;t sure. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Theo stuffed his mouth with as much spaghetti as possible and took his tray to the counter. They stepped outside onto the playground and walked around the edge, far from the other kids. They walked and walked and Pete seemed unable to speak, so Theo finally broke the ice with, &#x201c;What happened to your cheek?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know all about lawyers and stuff, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess. Both of my parents are lawyers. I&#x2019;ve sort of absorbed a lot. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dad drinks a lot, does some drugs. He came home late Saturday night drunk, and he and my mom got into a big fight. He smacked her around, busted a lip, there was some blood. I&#x2019;m the oldest kid, two younger sisters, and I tried to help my mom. He slapped me a few times. My sister Sharon, she&#x2019;s ten, called 911 and the police came. They arrested my dad and took him away. It was terrible, just terrible. He&#x2019;s in jail, and now my mom, and me and my sisters, too, are really afraid of what will happen when he gets out.&#x201d;</p><p>...</p></p><h2>The Dread Line: A Mulligan Novel (Liam Mulligan, 5)</h2><p><p><i>The Dread Line: </i>the latest Liam Mulligan novel from award winning author Bruce DeSilva.</p><p>Since he got fired in spectacular fashion from his newspaper job last year, former investigative reporter Liam Mulligan has been piecing together a new life--one that straddles both sides of the law. He's getting some part-time work with his friend McCracken's detective agency. He's picking up beer money by freelancing for a local news website. And he's looking after his semi-retired mobster-friend's bookmaking business. </p><p>But Mulligan still manages to find trouble. He's feuding with a cat that keeps leaving its kills on his porch. He's obsessed with a baffling jewelry heist. And he's enraged that someone in town is torturing animals. All this keeps distracting him from a big case that needs his full attention. The New England Patriots, shaken by a series of murder charges against a star player, have hired Mulligan and McCracken to investigate the background of a college athlete they're thinking of drafting. At first, the job seems routine, but as soon as they begin asking questions, they get push-back. The player, it seems, has something to hide--and someone is willing to kill to make sure it remains secret.</p></p><p>A year after getting fired from his investigative reporter job at a dying newspaper in <i>A Scourge of Vipers</i>, Liam Mulligan is piecing together a new life for himself in <i>The Dread Line</i>, one that straddles both sides of the law.&nbsp; After twenty years as a reporter, he feels odd living above the poverty line--and even odder to be a lawbreaker. But the way he sees it, he's not breaking any important ones. And of course, he's still finding trouble when it's not finding him.Bruce DeSilva grew up in a tiny Massachusetts mill town where the mill closed when he was ten, and where metaphors and alliteration were always in short supply. Nevertheless, his crime fiction has won the Edgar and MaCavity Awards, been listed as a finalist for the Shamus, Anthony and Barry Awards, and been published in ten foreign languages.His short stories have appeared in Akashic Press's noir anthologies, and he has reviewed books for <i>The New York Times Sunday Book Review, Publishers Weekly</i>, and The Associated Press. Previously, he was a journalist for forty years, most recently as world-wide writing coach for the Associated Press, editing stories that won every major journalism prize including the Pulitzer.</p><h2>The Hanging in the Hotel (Fethering Mysteries)</h2><p>While waitressing at the Hopwicke Country House Hotel as a favor for a friend, Jude once again becomes involved in murder when a member of the Pillars of Sussex, a group of local businessmen, is found dead, and Jude, suspecting foul play, enlists Carole Seddon&#39;s assistance to launch their own investigation.</p><p>Simon Brett is the author of the Fethering mystery series and the Mrs. Pargeter mystery series, and is the creator of the Charles Paris mysteries. He is also a former president of Britain&#39;s Crime Writers&#39; Association and chair of the Society of Authors.*Starred Review* An Edwardian country house converted into a sumptuous hotel, complete with sweeping views of the South Downs and the English Channel, provides the setting for two murders in Brett's fifth Fethering mystery. This may sound like another fraying-around-the-edges formulaic cozy, but not in the hands of Brett, who once constructed backstage, behind-the-mike British theater mysteries starring an alcoholic, fading actor-sleuth. Brett infuses his plots with scathing and hilarious social commentary; reading him is very much like deciphering Hogarth's pictorial send-ups of low and high society. Brett's latest sleuths are middle-aged women in the seaside village of Fethering-- Carole Seddon, an early-retired, acerbic refugee from the Home Office, and her neighbor, Jude, a blowsy, New Agey freethinker. They have stumbled upon (and over) bodies on the beach, on the Downs, and on the grounds of a museum. Jude has the honors of finding a body this time as she helps out at the local hotel--the body of a young man strangled by a cord on a four-poster bed. Even odder than the man's death is the fact that seemingly everyone wants to dismiss this and a subsequent death at the hotel as accidental or suicide, especially the members of the all-male, all-powerful Pillars of Sussex, to which one victim belonged and the other aspired. Intricate plotting and wry comedy make this the best Fethering yet. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

That we are all meant to be &#x201c;vanilla-busters&#x201d;; men and women who refuse to settle for an ordinary, mundane, adventure-deleted life. It is about abandoning the security and safety of the bleachers to enter into the dangers and glories of the playing field. It&#x2019;s about giving up small dreams and bite-sized ambitions so that we can take hold of dreams and ambitions big enough to make our stay on planet earth worthwhile. It&#x2019;s refusing to allow someone else to do our risk-taking, and daring to live life at full throttle. It&#x2019;s about saying &#x201c;no&#x201d; to vanilla, and shouting &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to life. Jim Collins, in his best-selling book &#x201c;Good to Great&#x201d;, wrote an outstanding analysis of what separates the very best companies from the myriads of good ones. In it he carefully details the central, key, non-negotiable characteristics which marked each of these very best companies. In a very similar way, &#x201c;Say &#x2018;No&#x2019; to Vanilla&#x201d; does the exact same thing - only with people instead of companies. What are those few, key, non-negotiable traits which separate great existences from good or mediocre ones? What does it take to upgrade one&#x2019;s life from &#x201c;good to great&#x201d;? Or another way to put it, what are &#x201c;the common threads of uncommon lives&#x201d;? For more than five decades, best-selling author Dwight Edwards has been studying and pondering this very issue. In this landmark book, he discusses in fascinating and compelling detail the five key components of individuals who have dared to become the best they could become and elevated their lives from good to great. The book is packed full of historical and biographical illustrations to support his five key traits.

With characteristic rigor and insight, in this book Mark Noll revisits the history of the American church in the context of world events. He makes the compelling case that <em>how</em> Americans have come to practice the Christian faith is just as globally important as <em>what</em> the American church has done in the world. He backs up this substantial claim with the scholarly attentiveness we've come to expect from him, lucidly explaining the relationship between the development of Christianity in North America and the development of Christianity in the rest of the world, with attention to recent transfigurations in world Christianity. Here is a book that will challenge your assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the American church and the global church in the past and predict what world Christianity may look like.</p><p>Mark A. Noll (Ph.D., Vanderbilt University) is Francis McAnaney Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is advisory editor for Books &amp; Culture and subeditor for the new Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Noll's main academic interests concern the interaction of Christianity and culture in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Anglo-American societies. He has published articles and reviews on a wide variety of subjects involving Christianity in modern history. Some of his many books include The Civil War as a Theological Crisis, Is the Reformation Over?, The Rise of Evangelicalism: The Age of Edwards, Whitefield and the Wesleys and The Old Religion in a New World."With insightful research and poignant historical observation, Noll effectively demonstrates that American individualism, voluntarism, and anti-institutionalism have had a much greater impact on the global church than have money, resources, or power. Noll adds an innovative thesis to our understanding of the contribution of U.S. churches to the amazing growth of the non-Western church." (The 2010 Christianity Today Book Awards, Missions/Global Affairs Category Winner, February 2010)<br><br>"The best teachers are also learners, and this book is eloquent testimony to Mark Noll's stature as both wise teacher and continuing student. His thesis is simple: that similarity of historical conditions, rather than direct influence, is what links (white) American evangelicalism with much of non-Western Christianity today. One need not agree with all his arguments to recognize that Noll's nuanced approach is a very important counter to ideologues of both the left and the right." (Vinoth Ramachandra, author of Subverting Global Myths)<br><br>"Scholars have become increasingly attentive to the changing tides of world Christianity and the implications for historiography, doing theology and understanding contemporary patterns of mission. Mark Noll looks back into the nineteenth century when America appropriated and transformed inherited European Christian traditions. The startling conclusions are that the contemporary currents in the Global South resemble the American Christianity at the turn of the century, that it is this emergent form that America shared with the world, and that neither money nor military power and influence could explain the American contribution to world Christianity. This refreshing and robust profile of American Christian influence has many implications: it explains why, among the industrialized nations, Christianity has remained resilient in the American public space; it counters the discourses in which Americanization appears as a negative epithet, a sign of hegemony and negative, extravenous influence. This lucid account has introduced a new dimension that will certainly stimulate the debate on the encounter between the local and global processes in the interpretation of contemporary Christianity." (Ogbu U. Kalu, Henry Winters Luce Professor of World Christianity and Mission, McCormick Theological Seminary, and director, Chicago Center for Global Ministries)<br><br>"The United States has emerged as a crucial frontier of the worldwide Christian awakening, in part because of America's role as a global power but in large part because of similar experiences rooted in history and civil society. From his own evangelical background, Mark Noll has explored these connections with lucid sensitivity and lively attentiveness, and in so doing has offered a welcome and valuable contribution to the literature on world Christianity and its critical interface with American religious history." (Lamin Sanneh, professor of world Christianity, professor of history and professor of international and area studies, Yale University, and director, World Christianity Initiative at Yale Divinity School)<br><br>"Mark Noll's novel thesis is that the real influence of American Christianity lies in its principle of voluntarism, which global Christianity has also found to be the most effective means to spread the gospel with or without American aid. This modest account of American influence should give pause for thought to both advocates and opponents of American hegemony in contemporary global Christian mission." (Simon Chan, Earnest Lau Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Theological College, Singapore)<br><br>"This fine book is one more in a long list of insightful and thought-provoking works by Mark Noll, although it gets him into new territory, that of world Christianity. Here once again is Noll's gift for deftly summarizing other scholars' findings and adding his own creative analysis to make for a stimulating product. This book is a fine antidote to the tendency toward either extreme triumphalism or self-flagellation on the issue of America's place on the world Christian scene." (Daniel H. Bays, professor of history and Asian studies, Calvin College)<br><br>"This book provides deep insight into the relationship between American evangelicalism and the growth of Christianity around the world. Master historian Mark Noll argues that American experience provides the template for much of world Christianity today. Readers will enjoy these thoughtful reflections written with Noll's typical clarity and creativity." (Dana L. Robert, Truman Collins Professor of World Mission, Boston University)<br><br>"Why does much of Christian worship and witness today in Africa, Asia and Latin America resemble American Christianity? Mark Noll argues that the rising churches of the Global South and East develop 'American' forms because the social forces they encounter resemble those that shaped American Christianity. Even though thousands of American missionaries have served in these lands, local trends and needs influence the churches far more than Americans do. In making his case, Noll offers a deft overview, filled with fascinating examples, of world Christianity today. For Americans who want to learn something about Christianity as a world religion, this book is a fine place to start." (Joel Carpenter, Nagel Institute for the Study of World Christianity, Calvin College)<br><br>"Christians around the world rely on intellectual leaders such as Mark Noll to synthesize, challenge and propose. This book synthesizes the rising literature on global Christianity, challenges received conceptions about the American role and proposes new ways of seeing which take the issues of global reflexivity seriously. Wrapped in Noll's measured, insightful prose, this is a book which should be read by thoughtful Christians seeking to understand the most significant questions of our day." (Mark Hutchinson, associate professor and dean of academic advancement, Southern Cross College, Sydney, Australia)<br><br>"Here is a book that both critics and supporters of missions must read. Noll helps us move beyond the simple praise and blame associated with Western missions to see the complexity and glory of the growth of Christianity, and, in the process, opens up new frontiers of understanding and new lines of research."

So it's an unpleasant surprise when he's awakened at 8:38 a.m. by a phone call from his boss, telling him a local policeman was killed and to get the story. Shaking himself awake, Carter heads off to interview the cop's widow. And then he gets another call: the story's off, the cop committed suicide.</p><p>But Carter can't understand why a man with a job he loved, a beautiful wife, and plans to take his adorable children to Disney World would suddenly kill himself. And when Carter's attempts to learn more are repeatedly blocked, it's clear someone knows more than he's saying about the cop's death. The question is, who? And what does he have to hide?

A former reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The [Newark] Star-Ledger</i>, he lives in Virginia, and <i>The Good Cop</i> is his fourth novel.CHAPTER 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Among the many reasons I enjoy being a newspaper reporter&#x2014;not the least of which are the freedom, the fun, and the constitutionally protected right to announce when people are acting like idiots&#x2014;one of the small-but-important pleasures is what I&#x2019;m doing each morning at eight thirty-eight. <br>At 8:38 A.M., I imagine most gainfully employed, industrious members of our society are already enjoined in the struggle that is their daily grind. They have attended to their grooming needs, squeezed themselves into their workaday uniforms, rushed through a meal that puts the &#x201c;fast&#x201d; in &#x201c;breakfast,&#x201d; and made the necessary concessions to their caffeine addictions. <br>At 8:38 A.M., they are inhaling the carbon-tinged exhaust fumes from the car in front of them on the Garden State Parkway; or they are recovering from the latest skirmish in the ongoing Battle of No, You <i>Cannot</i> Wear That to School; or they are checking their e-mails, looking at their schedules, and generally girding themselves for all that is to come. <br>Me? <br>At 8:38 A.M., I do solemnly swear that I, Carter Ross, am asleep. <br>In my profession, this is not necessarily a sign of sloth. Editors typically have established hours, but reporters adapt their schedules to the demands of their beat. Courthouse reporters are at the whim of their trial; education reporters learn to make calls during the school day; sports reporters, the vampires of the journalism world, primarily work at night. As an investigative reporter, I don&#x2019;t have a beat per se. No one expects to see me in the office at any particular time of the day, and certainly not at 8:38 A.M., when most self-respecting American newsrooms are devoid of all but the barest minimum of personnel. Anywhere from ten to eleven is considered a more fashionable arrival time. So I pretty much get up when I feel like it. I have a need to set an alarm maybe five times a year. <br>I often make up for it on the other end because while my day may come in like a lamb, it often goes out like a lion, with sources and editors and deadline all screaming at me simultaneously. My employer, the <i>Newark Eagle-Examiner</i>&#x2014;New Jersey&#x2019;s largest and most tenacious disseminator of responsibly vetted information&#x2014;always gets its pound of flesh out of me. <br>Nevertheless, if I do happen to wake up when there is an unsightly number (like an eight or, God forbid, a seven) leading the digital clock by my bedside, I take pride in rolling over and snoozing until I see a more proper number (like a nine or a ten). The main characters in my life&#x2014;be it my colleagues, my friends, or Deadline, the cat who reliably joins me in my morning slumber&#x2014;know this about me. <br>So it came as something of a surprise when I became aware that my landline, the number almost no one used anymore, was ringing one sunless Monday morning in March at exactly 8:38 A.M. <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I said, sounding a bit guttural. <br>&#x201c;Carter, it&#x2019;s Katie Mossman.&#x201d; <br>Katie was one of the editors on what was formally called the Nonstop News Desk, which had been created a few years back to feed the insatiable content beast that is our Web site. Informally, we reporters called it the All-Slop News Desk&#x2014;&#x201c;the Slop&#x201d; for short&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s about what we shoveled into it. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Katie?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We got a dead Newark cop,&#x201d; she replied, and I immediately sat up in bed and grabbed a notepad. <br>For as much as law enforcement and media sometimes find themselves at odds, we in the Fourth Estate recognize that those who are sworn to uphold the law not only perform a vital function for public safety but represent all of us in doing it. An attack on one of their number is an attack on everyone. Police officers who die in the line of duty are heroes and are treated as such. In other words, dead cops equal big news. <br>&#x201c;Okay. What do you need from me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t think we have a game plan yet. I just called Tina to tell her about it and she said I should call you and, quote, &#x2018;Get his sorry ass out of bed.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>As the assistant managing editor for local news, Tina Thompson was my boss. She and I also had a fairly complex, on-and-off relationship (currently: off). In both roles, she was not especially shy about expressing her needs. <br>&#x201c;You can tell her it&#x2019;s out,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this cop&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;From what we&#x2019;re hearing, it&#x2019;s Darius Kipps. K-I-P-P-S. Detective Sergeant Darius Kipps.&#x201d; <br>The name meant nothing to me. While I wasn&#x2019;t strictly a cops reporter, I had a decent number of contacts in the Newark Police Department. Still, there were more than a thousand cops on the force and I knew only a fraction of them. <br>&#x201c;What happened to him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that yet, either. The Newark PD hasn&#x2019;t announced any of this. We&#x2019;re just getting this from sources. We haven&#x2019;t even put it online yet because we don&#x2019;t have it confirmed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So how do we know this mystery cop is dead?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;One of the photogs was listening to the scanner this morning and said there was a lot of chatter about something going down at the Fourth Precinct. We figured it out from there.&#x201d; <br>I knew the Fourth Precinct well. It was in the Central Ward, in the heart of a Newark neighborhood that had been making news, not all of it good, for a long time. <br>&#x201c;Got it. What does Tina want from me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Plans are still being formed. At this point, she just wants everyone in here. It&#x2019;s one of those all-hands-on-deck things.&#x201d; <br>That, of course, was the reaction of most editors to a big story. Gather up your reporters&#x2014;they sometimes referred to us as &#x201c;resources&#x201d; so we wouldn&#x2019;t be confused with human beings&#x2014;and then figure out what to do with us later. It usually just meant we&#x2019;d be bumping into one another all day long. <br>But, in truth, the only thing worse than doing all that bumping was being left out of it. I told Katie her message had been delivered, then hung up. There would be no dawdling in bed on this day. Anyone with reporter&#x2019;s blood flowing in his veins&#x2014;and I fancied myself as having a lot of it&#x2014;wanted in on a story like this. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>As a thirty-two-year-old bachelor with no significant encumbrances, I can be showered, dressed, and ready to ramble in fifteen minutes. Twelve if I really push it. <br>I streamline this process in several ways. One, there is nothing complicated about my hair. It&#x2019;s brown and short&#x2014;never more than four weeks away from being cut&#x2014;and I part it on the side, the same way I&#x2019;ve been doing it since I was old enough to hold a brush. <br>Two, my morning routine involves a bare minimum of lotionry and potionry. I&#x2019;ve been told the modern male ought to concern himself with hair product, moisturizer, cologne and/or body spray, and perhaps a half-dozen other products from the health and beauty aisle, all carefully applied and then painstakingly primped. Me, I wear deodorant (primarily out of consideration to my fellow man). <br>Three, my wardrobe is, quite deliberately, the most boring thing you&#x2019;ve ever seen. I have two possible colors of pleated slacks (charcoal and khaki), two colors of shirt (white and blue) and three colors of necktie (red, yellow, or blue). And if you notice, any of the twelve resulting color combinations match just fine. So I can pretty much dive into my closet and grab blindly for anything that&#x2019;s clean, knowing I can&#x2019;t miss. <br>The end result of all this is not particularly inspiring&#x2014;I make a Land&#x2019;s End catalogue look avant-garde by comparison&#x2014;but it works for me. You have to know what flavor of ice cream you are in this world, and I am vanilla. <br>On this day, my closet dive yielded the racy blend of khaki pants, a white shirt, and a blue tie. I tossed a bit of kibble in a bowl for Deadline&#x2014;not that he would be awake to eat it for another few hours&#x2014;then opened my laptop. <br>I had no intention of going into the office to be one of Tina Thompson&#x2019;s &#x201c;resources,&#x201d; which would just involve sitting around a conference table until someone told me to do what any good reporter should have been doing all along. Sometimes editors just get in the way like that. <br>So I got to work. After about five minutes of accessing a few of the databases on which a reporter makes his living, I learned the late Darius Kipps had been with the Newark Police Department for twelve years and three months. He was thirty-seven years old, having celebrated his birthday on the first of March. He was making $93,140 a year, which is not unusual in a state with the nation&#x2019;s highest paid police officers. He had a variety of addresses associated with him&#x2014;some in Newark, some in Irvington&#x2014;but seemed to have settled in East Orange. <br>Sure enough, when I checked the East Orange property tax records, I found a dwelling owned by Noemi and Darius Kipps on Rutledge Avenue. <br>And that, I had already decided as I closed the lid on my laptop, was where I needed to be. <br>This was something of a calculated gamble on my part. Without knowing how Darius Kipps met his untimely end, there was no telling what would figure prominently in our story. But, sadly, I could proffer up a reasonable guess. He was a detective, which is usually a pretty safe place for a cop. Unless, of course, you&#x2019;re undercover. Then you&#x2019;re just as exposed to danger as anyone else who tries to make a life on the streets. If not more so. All it takes is some punk deciding you looked at him the wrong way and, not knowing you&#x2019;re a cop, pulling the trigger. <br>Or maybe something else had befallen Detective Sergeant Kipps. Point is, we had cops reporters who were in a better position to figure it out, leaving me to work other angles. And in a story like this, it was safe to assume that the grieving widow, Noemi Kipps, would be one of those angles. <br>That meant every minute counted. This was not necessarily out of any concern for the paper&#x2019;s production schedule. It was all about the competition or, more accurately, the lack of it. <br>A Newark police officer killed in the line of duty would inevitably attract the attention of every television and radio station in the Greater New York area, which only happens to be the biggest media market in the country. All of them would know a grieving widow was a big part of the story, too. And since they have access to the same databases I did, they, too, would soon be heading in the direction of Rutledge Avenue in East Orange. <br>The cumulative effect of all those reporters would be something like cattle in a field. Put one cow in a small pasture, and what you have is a nice, green plot of earth. She can roam freely, nibbling grass as she feels like it, and generally has a pretty good time of things. Put a whole bunch of cows in that same field, and what you have in fairly short order is a big, stinky, muddy mess. And none of the cows feel like they&#x2019;re getting much of a meal. <br>So the trick is to be that first cow, then find a way to lock the gate so the rest of the herd can&#x2019;t get in. <br>Bidding Deadline farewell&#x2014;he would miss me, but only due to the absence of body heat&#x2014;I went out into the gray morning, hopped in my car, and began the short drive from my home in Bloomfield to the Kipps household in East Orange. <br>Along the way, I called Tina. There was a time when Tina and I had a fairly simple understanding: she simply wanted my seed. After two decades of using her beauty and cunning to run roughshod over the male species, cycling through its representatives in a series of relationships that lasted anywhere from one night to one month, she had reached a point where she realized her baby-making years were running short. <br>She was far too practical and goal-oriented to engage in the imprecise business of courtship, so she mostly judged men on their potential to pass certain desirable characteristics onto her offspring. She was looking for a partner with blue eyes and broad shoulders (check). She wanted him to be at least six feet tall (I&#x2019;m six foot one). And she was looking for a certain kindly, easygoing disposition (howdy, friend). Hence, she decided I was the ideal sperm donor&#x2014;and that rather than making the swap in a laboratory, we might as well do it as nature intended. <br>She made it clear it was a no-strings-attached proposition, that I could taste the fruit without buying the orchard, as it were. The only problem was, I sort of wanted the orchard. So we had reached an impasse in our relationship: namely, I wanted one and she didn&#x2019;t. <br>Then she got promoted and became my editor, which imposed further impediments to the possibility of our getting together. So we sort of decided to cool it. I say &#x201c;sort of&#x201d; because nothing felt very cool when we wound up together after work, especially after a drink or two. <br>Then, in an unexpected development, I got tired of all that will-they-or-won&#x2019;t-they stuff and started dating Kira O&#x2019;Brien, a new librarian in the newspaper&#x2019;s research department. Actually, I&#x2019;m not sure you could call what we did &#x201c;dating.&#x201d; But that was another story. <br>Point is, things had been a little strained between Tina and me. She answered her cell phone with a testy: &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading to East Orange.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in East Orange?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The widow Kipps, from what I&#x2019;ve been able to learn,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Who told you to go after the widow Kipps?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No one. But I live about five minutes from her. I can make it there and try to get her talking before every television station in New York has a hairpiece and a microphone camped on her front lawn.&#x201d; <br>Tina didn&#x2019;t respond for a second or two. I&#x2019;m sure she was trying to find some reason my plan was a bad one&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s sort of the way things had been going between us lately&#x2014;but there were really no nits to pick. <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t screw it up.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Knocking on the door of a woman who has just lost her husband&#x2014;and then having the nerve to ask her all about it&#x2014;is certainly not one of the cheerier parts of my chosen profession. Done poorly, it can leave you feeling like some exploitative, soul-sucking parasite who feasts on the misery of others. Some reporters flatly loathe the task, even citing it as a reason for leaving the business. <br>But, strange as it sounds, it might be one of the things I find most satisfying. It&#x2019;s not that I enjoy other people&#x2019;s suffering or that I find the whole business any less discomfiting than anyone else. <br>It&#x2019;s that I see it as an opportunity to do some real good, in my small way. One of the fundamental things I believe as a writer is that words have the power to move people. They can make us feel angry or hateful or sad, sure. But they can also uplift us. They can provide hope. They can even comfort a grieving family. <br>And that&#x2019;s what I went into a situation like this trying to do. I believed I could wade into the agony of the Kipps family, and by writing a sympathetic story about Darius&#x2014;something that captured the best of the man, his service to others and the sacrifice he made&#x2014;I could make things a little better. Maybe not right away, when everything was still so fresh. But maybe someday it could be something his widow could look at and read with a smile on her face. <br>With this in mind, I made the turn onto Rutledge Avenue, a street lined with mature trees and cracked sidewalks. East Orange could be a rough town, having long ago been overtaken by the same urban malaise that blighted much of Newark. But this was one of the more livable areas. The definition of &#x201c;livable&#x201d; was, of course, that the dope fiends, dealers, and delinquents tended to stay at least a few blocks away. <br>I slowed as I reached the Kippses&#x2019; residence, an aging two-story brick duplex with a flower bed full of dead leaves that had accumulated over the winter. There were no window treatments on t...</p><h2>Cat Playing Cupid (Joe Grey Mystery Series, 14)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Excellent....These Joe Grey mysteries will stay popular for many years to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Tampa</i><i> Tribune</i></p><p>&nbsp;<i></i></p><p><em>Kirkus Reviews </em>says that award-winning author Shirley Rousseau Murphy has &#x201c;raised the stakes of the feline sleuth genre.&#x201d;<i> </i>In <i>Cat Playing Cupid,</i> Murphy&#x2019;s fourteenth delightfully sophisticated whodunit to feature Joe Grey and his furry friends Dulcie and Kit, the feline P.I. is on a mission to stop a crime spree that endangers love on Valentine&#x2019;s Day.

Its ferocity and hatreds were rivaled only by the bloody battles and assassinations of the Lincoln County war in New Mexico ten years before, but it is doubtful, even with all its terrorism, if the number killed there equaled the casualties of Pleasant Valley. Both were born of blood feuds, and bother were fought in defiance of the law of the land until they burned themselves out after most of the participants has either been killed or had grown weary of strife. Even the well-know Hatfield-McCoy feud that held the West Virginia and Kentucky mountains under a reign of terror for almost twenty years did not surpass the lifelong hatred born of the Pleasant Valley war. It is a singular fact that in all three of these vendettas, in such widely separated localities, officers of the law were unable to stop bloodshed. Echoes of the fighting in Lincoln County reached President Hayes at Washington, but, in spite of the fact that he appointed General Lew Wallace Governor of New Mexico for the special purpose of restoring order, the law was powerless. Authentic information has been very difficult to obtain, for the dreaded hand of the feud still reaches down across nearly half a century and seals the lips of most of those who might tell its bitter, sanguinary story. To this day it is an unpardonable sin in central Arizona to &#34;talk too much,&#34; even more so than a quarter of a century ago; and many persons who took no part but are acquainted with the facts and gave me valuable information requested that their names be withheld, for personal and business reasons.</p><p></p><h2>The Odes of Horace</h2><p>Purchase of this book includes free trial access to www.million-books.com where you can read more than a million books for free.

Not the rich grain, that waves along Sardinia's fertile land, Nor the unnumber'd herds, that throng Calabria's sultry strand; Not gold, nor ivory's snowy gleam, The spoil of far Cathay, Nor fields, which I/iris, quiet stream, Gnaws silently away. Let fortune's favour'd sons the vine Of fair Campania hold ; The merchant quaff the rarest wine From cups of gleaming gold; For to the gods the man is dear Who scathelessly can brave, Three times or more in every year, The wild Atlantic wave. Let olives, endive, mallows light Be all my fare ; and health Give thou, Latoe, so I might Enjoy my present wealth !

Sporting a hip handlebar mustache and goatee and endowed with a personality as big as his seat-filling body, Dan motors through town and country settings like there's no tomorrow. Noisy fun, with a strong beat and a narrative pattern that even younger audiences will have no trouble catching."&nbsp;- Kirkus ReviewThis hepcat musical riff on &#x201c;This Is the House That Jack Built&#x201d; stars Dan the Taxi Man, who picks up the five members of a band and delivers them to the Rockin&#x2019; Joint for a show. Maureen and her tambourine, Tyrone with his saxophone, Star with her electric guitar, Claire with a rattly snare, and Ace with his upright bass each crowd into Dan&#x2019;s taxi. With the addition of each player, the rhymes are cumulatively repeated: &#x201c;Climb inside while you still can / with Dan, / Beep! Beep! / the Taxi Man.&#x201d; The font styles and sizes should generate appropriate instrument noises from readers; for example, Star&#x2019;s &#x201c;Whee, wazzle, wah&#x201d;; Tyrone&#x2019;s &#x201c;Squeeba-dee dee&#x201d;; and, of course, Dan&#x2019;s ever-honking horn. The brightly colored, energetic illustrations carry out the mod motif with mohawk hair, dreads, an afro, pierced ears, and Dan&#x2019;s red handlebar mustache.

I hate you!&#x201d; Christy Miller shouted at her reflection in the closet-door mirror. With a wild <i>grrrr </i>she wadded up her beach towel and heaved it at the mirror, watching it wobble and distort her lanky proportions.<br><br>&#x201c;Christy darling?&#x201d; came a shrill voice from the hallway. &#x201c;Are you back from the beach so soon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Aunt Marti.&#x201d; Christy grabbed a brush and pretended to be untangling her long, nutmeg-brown hair.<br><br>Her aunt, a slim, stylish woman in her forties, opened the guest room door and looked around. &#x201c;What was all the commotion? Who were you talking to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody. Just myself,&#x201d; Christy answered calmly, trying to suppress the volcano of fiery emotions boiling within her.<br><br>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you out on the beach, dear? It&#x2019;s a gorgeous day, and here you sit in your room, talking to yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Marti dramatically pointed her acrylic fingernail toward the door. &#x201c;You should be out there enjoying yourself!&#x201d;<br><br>Christy bit her quivering lip and didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>&#x201c;This is California. Live a little! We didn&#x2019;t fly you all the way from Wisconsin so you could spend the summer hiding in your room. Get out there and make some friends.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly the internal volcano erupted with great force, spewing words with the hot tears. &#x201c;I tried, all right?&#x201d; Christy choked. &#x201c;I tried to get in with some of the beach kids, but they&#x2019;re all a bunch of snobs! I can&#x2019;t stand them! They&#x2019;re rude and mean, and they laughed at me.&#x201d; Christy covered her face with her hands; the tears oozed through her fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;I had no idea!&#x201d; Her aunt switched tones and ushered Christy to the edge of the bed. There, there. Tell me what&#x2019;s bothering you, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>It took Christy a few minutes to compose herself before she said calmly, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fit in with the people here. They think I&#x2019;m a nerd.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, are you?&#x201d; her aunt challenged.<br><br>&#x201c;Am I what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A nerd.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy didn&#x2019;t answer. She stared across the room at her reflection in the mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; her aunt prodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at me, Aunt Martha!&#x201d; Christy jumped up from the bed and stood in front of her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m as white as a frosty cone&#x2013;sort of shaped like one too! If that doesn&#x2019;t make me a nerd in Newport Beach, I don&#x2019;t know what does!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really, Christy. A frosty cone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, look at me.&#x201d; Christy stretched out her arms to provide a full view of her 5-foot-5-inch, 110-pound frame. Her one-piece bathing suit covered her Olive Oyl torso like a bright green Ace bandage.<br><br> &#x201c;Tell me I don&#x2019;t look like a frosty cone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look like a frosty cone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that.&#x201d; Christy plopped on the floor and folded her arms across her stomach.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come now, Christy. You might be a bit of a late bloomer, but really, you&#x2019;re a very sweet girl, and you&#x2019;ve got a lot of potential.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, right. Tell that to the surfers out there. The one who said, &#x2018;Hey! It&#x2019;s a walking green bean.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Her aunt looked confused. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d;<br><br>Christy let the tears drip and sniffed loudly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see that you got upset over a little remark about a green bean. That doesn&#x2019;t make sense at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They meant <i>me</i>, Aunt Marti! No other girl on the beach had on a bathing suit like this ugly one! <i>I&#x2019;m </i>the walking green bean!&#x201d;<br><br>Christy covered her face with her hands and cried until the tears ran down her arms. It was the kind of crying that comes from the pit of the stomach and brings a headache with it. The kind that makes a person snort and gasp, and no matter how idiotic you feel or how hard you try, you can&#x2019;t stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Do calm yourself, will you, dear? It&#x2019;s not as bad as all that. We can certainly buy you a new bathing suit easily enough. And just think. They called you a bean, not a frosty cone. See? They&#x2019;re saying you&#x2019;re thin. That&#x2019;s almost a compliment.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy gasped in short spasms, trying to relax.<br><br>Her aunt took the opportunity to make her point. &#x201c;This is exactly the reason I told your mother I wanted you to spend the summer with us. You deserve more than your parents can give you right now, and goodness knows your mother and I didn&#x2019;t have much when we were growing up.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy wiped her nose with the back of her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Here. Use this, will you please?&#x201d; Marti handed her a tissue. &#x201c;As I was saying, my goal this summer is to treat you to some of the finer things in life and to teach you, Christina Juliet Miller, how to become your own person.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy blinked and tried to suppress a wild belch that bubbled up as a result of so much sobbing. Too late. The muffled <i>urp </i>leaked out.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certainly not going to make this easy for me, are you, dear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Christy felt an uncontrollable urge to laugh. &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re ready to transform a belching green bean frosty cone into &#x2018;her own person&#x2019;? Could be<br>kind of dangerous!&#x201d; Christy broke into laughter.<br><br>Aunt Marti shook her head and didn&#x2019;t join in. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start tomorrow, Christina. I&#x2019;ll call and make an appointment for you to have your colors done at nine, and then we&#x2019;ll start shopping for your new wardrobe.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy instantly sobered. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t bring much money with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly! This is my treat. A few outfits are certainly not going to break me. And one other thing: We really should have your hair cut. Something short and stylish. My hairdresser, Maurice, does marvelous work. By the time we&#x2019;re done with you you&#x2019;ll look and feel like a new person.&#x201d;<br><br>She said it with such finesse, Christy almost believed her. A new wardrobe? A new hairstyle? And what did her aunt mean by &#x201c;having her colors done&#x201d;? <br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you shower and dress, dear? Your uncle doesn&#x2019;t know it yet, but he&#x2019;s going to take you to an early dinner and a movie tonight.&#x201d; Aunt Marti swished out the door.<br><br>Christy approached the mirror with a new perspective. Twisting her long, nutmeg-brown hair on top of her head, she posed this way and that way, trying to imagine how she would look with short hair. She couldn&#x2019;t quite picture the change.<br><br>She wished Paula were there. Paula, her best friend back home, always gave her advice when it came to major decisions like this. But then, what did Paula know? She was the one who helped her pick out the dumb green bean bathing suit!<br><br>Christy scrunched up her nose and stuck her face close to the mirror, examining her skin for new blemishes. No new and ugly bumps today. But her cheeks were flushed, and her nose was bright red from crying. Even her eyes showed the effects of her crying spree; they were puffy and bloodshot.<br><br>&#x201c;I have such stupid eyes,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not blue, and they&#x2019;re not green. They&#x2019;re just sort of nothing&#x2013;like the rest of me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Knock, knock,&#x201d; Uncle Bob called out from Christy&#x2019;s open door.<br><br>She immediately released her hair and turned away from the mirror, embarrassed that he had caught her in the midst of such scrutiny.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;ve got a date tonight for the movies.&#x201d; His merry eyes looked at her from beneath his baseball cap. He must have just come back from golfing, judging by the perspiration stains on his polo shirt. &#x201c;Anything special you want to see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll take a look in the paper to see what&#x2019;s playing. Your aunt&#x2019;s not much of a movie fan, so I hope you don&#x2019;t mind that it&#x2019;s just you and me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. That&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave in about an hour, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; he lifted his baseball cap and wiped his forehead, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told you yet, but I&#x2019;m glad you came to stay with us this summer.&#x201d; Then he added, &#x201c;You are my favorite niece, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I also happen to be your only niece!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Minor detail, my child, minor detail,&#x201d; he quipped, politely closing the door.<br><br>With a sigh, Christy flopped onto the bed. She didn&#x2019;t feel like showering, and it wouldn&#x2019;t take her that long to change. With an hour to kill, she decided to write to Paula.<br><br>Christy liked to write&#x2013;especially when she had a lot on her mind. She would get everything out on paper, and then when she reread it, it would be like looking at her own thoughts in a mirror. Usually things came out clearer on paper than when she tried to say them.<br><br>Finding the pad of stationery Paula had given her when she left Wisconsin, Christy set to work. Paula insisted that she write the first letter to her on this stationery.<br><br><i>Dear Paula,<br>Hi! How&#x2019;s everything back on the farm?

It was because my parents were giving me a big lecture<br>about my trip out here. They made me promise I wouldn&#x2019;t do anything<br>this summer I would regret later. Can you believe that?<br><br>The funny part is, the only thing I regret is that I ever came here.<br>I hate this place! There&#x2019;s nothing to do, and everybody is so stuck up.<br>It&#x2019;s so boring. At night, all I do is sit around and watch TV.<br><br>At least one good thing is going to happen. Tomorrow my aunt<br>is going to take me shopping, and guess what? I&#x2019;m probably going to<br>get my hair cut! Can you believe it? I&#x2019;m kind of scared, but I think<br>she&#x2019;s trying to give me a new image or something.<br><br>Well, I&#x2019;ve got to go. I&#x2019;ll tell you how the big makeover turns<br>out.

Arthur has wrested the Sixth Key from Superior Saturday, but has fallen from the Incomparable Gardens; fallen not to the Upper House but to somewhere completely unexpected. Alone in enemy territory, as his mind and body are further transformed by the power of the Keys, Arthur must struggle with himself as much as with his many enemies. Meanwhile, Arthur&#39;s friend Suzy Blue plots an escape from her prison in Saturday&#39;s tower, as battle rages above and below. Saturday&#39;s elite force is pressing on into the Incomparable Gardens, while her massed sorcerers fight a desperate rear-guard action against the Piper and his Newnith army. On earth, Leaf has to cope with the aftermath of a nuclear strike. Responsible for all the Sleepers in Friday&#39;s private hospital, she needs all the help she can get, particularly as Leaf herself has become a target for intruders from the House. And the tide of Nothing continues to rise, destroying everything in its path ...</p><p>Garth Nix was born in 1963 and grew up in Canberra, Australia. After taking his degree in professional writing from the University of Canberra, he worked in a bookshop and then moved to Sydney. There he sank lower into the morass of the publishing industry, steadily devolving from sales rep through publicist until in 1991 he became a senior editor with a major multinational publisher. After a period travelling in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia in 1993, he left publishing to work as a marketing communications consultant . In 1999 he was lured back to the publishing world to become a part-time literary agent. He now lives in Sydney, a five-minute walk from Coogee Beach, with his wife Anna, son Thomas, and lots of books.The final book in Nix&#39;s gripping series needs a sophisticated narration, and it succeeds with Alan Corduner. He conveys the tension of the ticking clock as Arthur, Leif, and the denizens of the House struggle to hold back the Nothing and reunite all seven parts of the Will. Listeners will feel Arthur&#39;s conflicted feelings as he becomes irrevocably transformed by his quest. Corduner dramatizes the complexity of the series&#39; moral dilemmas through his outstanding characterizations. He creates identifiable voices for Arthur, Leif, and many others who anchor the different perspectives from which the story is told. Hearing the story through these well-crafted voices, listeners will have total confidence in Nix&#39;s imaginary world.

Some pieces address the archaeological and ethnographic evidence of psychedelic use as a vital part of early human development. Others focus on modern psychedelic history--such as pre-World War II psychedelic research and self-experimentation, or the fear-mongering nuclear era of the 1950s and 1960s, when psychedelics were banished into a forty-year Dark Ages. Still other pieces examine contemporary drug use, particularly MDMA and poly drug use (the use of a combination of drugs for a specific effect). The book concludes with a piece by Rick Doblin, PhD, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), in which he offers a bold vision of the future, one in which psychedelics and expanded consciousness are an integral part of modern cosmopolitan society.<br><br>Contents<br>Introduction <br>Altered States and the Prehistoric Ritualisation of the Modern Human Mind<br>Tracing Neolithic World Views: Shamanism, Irish Passage Tomb Art and Altered States of Consciousness<br>Towards an Exploration of the Mind of a Conquered Continent: Shamanism,<br>Sacred Plants and Amerindian Epistemology<br>"A Train of Delightful Visions": Early Scientific Encounters with Psychedelics<br>Psychedelic Formations in Literature<br>Drop Acid Not Bombs<br>Season of the Witch: 1966 and the Vilification of LSD in Britain<br>Breaking Conventions in Policy and Science<br>Religious Freedom and the Expansion of Ayahuasca Ceremonies in Europe<br>Introduction to the MDMA Debate<br>Poly and Mono: Reflections on the Validity of "Poly Drug Use"<br>From Meta-Sin to Medicine: A Program for Future Research into the Healing Power of Psychedelics<br>A Declaration of Psychedelic Studies<br>Biophenomenology of Altered States<br>Cognitive Phenomenology of Mind Manifestation<br>Psychedelics, Parapsychology and Exceptional Human Experiences<br>The Anaesthetic Revelation: Psychedelia and Mysticism<br>Deceptive Cadences: A Hermeneutic Approach to the Problem of Meaning and Psychedelic Experience<br>A Matter of Spirit: An Imaginal Perspective on the Paranormal<br>Communications from the Herbs: A Step-by-Step Guide to <i>Ini</i> Consciousness<br>Afterword: A Bold Vision, by Rick Doblin <br><b><br></b></p><p>CAMERON ADAMS is a research associate in the School of Anthropology and Conservation at the University of Kent, Canterbury, and a coorganizer of the annual Breaking Convention conferences.

Most of us can easily recall the adolescent social cliques, the high school pecking order, and which of our peers stood out as the most or the least popular teens we knew. Even as adults we all still remember exactly where we stood in the high school social hierarchy, and the powerful emotions associated with our status persist decades later. This may be for good reason.<br><br> <i>Popular</i> examines why popularity plays such a key role in our development and, ultimately, how it still influences our happiness and success today. In many ways&#x2014;some even beyond our conscious awareness&#x2014;those old dynamics of our youth continue to play out in every business meeting, every social gathering, in our personal relationships, and even how we raise our children. Our popularity even affects our DNA, our health, and our mortality in fascinating ways we never previously realized. More than childhood intelligence, family background, or prior psychological issues, research indicates that it&#x2019;s how popular we were in our early years that predicts how successful and how happy we grow up to be.<br><br> But it&#x2019;s not always the conventionally popular people who fare the best, for the simple reason that there is more than one type of popularity&#x2014;and many of us still long for the wrong one. As children, we strive to be likable, which can offer real benefits not only on the playground but throughout our lives. In adolescence, though, a new form of popularity emerges, and we suddenly begin to care about status, power, influence, and notoriety&#x2014;research indicates that this type of popularity hurts us more than we realize.<br><br> Realistically, we can&#x2019;t ignore our natural human social impulses to be included and well-regarded by others, but we can learn how to manage those impulses in beneficial and gratifying ways. <i>Popular</i> relies on the latest research in psychology and neuroscience to help us make the wisest choices for ourselves and for our children, so we may all pursue more meaningful, satisfying, and rewarding relationships.</p><p>Mitch Prinstein is the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and the Director of Clinical Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

That woman was Paula, a friend of mine from college. When I first met her, Paula had brown, tousled hair, and recently had lost some significant weight. Today, she is an ER nurse. She is married, has two sons, and has become a bit of a fashionista&#x2014;always buying new shoes and trendy handbags. Nevertheless, she usually still thinks of herself as &#x201c;that pudgy girl with the sloppy hair,&#x201d; and on that Tuesday evening, she texted me just before the start of the school board meeting at her son&#x2019;s middle school. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all coming back to me while I sit here. The teasing, the anxiety, the homework. I feel like someone may shoot a spitball at any moment. :)&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paula was at the meeting to lobby for funds that would revitalize a gifted program she desperately wanted for her children. After six months of trying without any progress, she was losing patience. She&#x2019;d written a coherent proposal, developed a budget, gathered data from comparable programs in nearby districts, and even asked a few teachers to testify on behalf of her idea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If we have a better gifted program, fewer parents will send their children to the local private school,&#x201d; she argued. &#x201c;The retention of gifted children in the school system will lead to better test scores and a return to the levels of state funding we had three years ago. The program will essentially pay for itself.&#x201d; But the previous month, the board had allocated funds for a faculty lounge in the same school instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I checked in with Paula a few days later to see how her meeting had gone. She told me that just before it started, a woman named Susan showed up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She walks in, probably just to show off another new Birkin bag, and looks around the room like we&#x2019;re supposed to throw roses at her feet or something,&#x201d; Paula said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Susan&#x2019;s daughter was in the same class as Paula&#x2019;s son. It was Susan&#x2019;s first appearance at a school board meeting. Several of the other parents in the room saw her and waved enthusiastically. One woman immediately ran over to give her a hug and cried, &#x201c;Oh my goodness, it has been so long. We have to catch up!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh, I got so annoyed when I saw how everyone kisses up to Susan,&#x201d; Paula told me. &#x201c;But I gave her a hug, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The meeting started, and the board president began by soliciting ideas for how to help the school develop a higher profile within the district. A few minutes into the discussion, Susan stood up and addressed the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree that we need to think about how to make ourschool stand out. I was visiting my sister last week in Michigan, and a few kids from the gifted program at her kid&#x2019;s middle school had just won a science tournament. The next thing you know, the school was in the paper, and the drug company that sponsored the tournament gave the school a big donation. Why don&#x2019;t we do that here? Do we even have a gifted program?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within thirty minutes, the board voted to approve additional funding for the program. Paula was both elated and furious&#x2014;it was great news for her son, but in a few minutes, Susan had achieved what Paula hadn&#x2019;t been able to do in six months. Susan hadn&#x2019;t offered any new arguments or presented any research on school funding trends. But somehow, her ideas got traction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone is always just so excited to do whatever Susan wants,&#x201d; Paula complained. &#x201c;Sometimes I can&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Joe is a professor at a well-known university. He&#x2019;s been on staff for ten years, but was not supposed to be next in line for a promotion. His more senior colleague, Franklin, has been in the same position three years longer and has a more impressive record of scientific publications. In just the past year, Franklin obtained a prestigious grant to support his work, and a top journal featured one of his papers as its lead article, suggesting that his research was making a very important impact in the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joe has also been publishing, but in journals of much lesser quality, and he has never been awarded a grant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, everyone loves Joe. He always has something amusing to offer at faculty meetings. He regularly makes the rounds up and down the halls of his department, having energetic doorway conversations, and he&#x2019;s always open-minded to whatever opinions are expressed when department politics emerge. People reflexively smile when they see him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is not the case with Franklin, though. In fact, heis so contentious that his very name has become an adjective in the department, as in: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s add this to the consent agenda, so no one gets all <i>Franklin</i> about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At one faculty meeting, the agenda included a discussion about which of two courses should be added to the requirements for a second undergraduate major offered by the department. A committee that had spent the past three months developing the proposal outlined the pros and cons for each of the course selections, and then asked for comments and questions. As Franklin&#x2019;s hand launched up, the rest of the faculty shifted in their chairs and avoided eye contact with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why we want a second major at all,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been saying for years that this is a huge waste of time that puts burden on our staff, and also on us. I spent three hours last week meeting with students about this, and I don&#x2019;t even know why we have it. One major is enough for our department!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Groans could be heard all around the room. Many of the faculty lowered their heads, ostensibly to check something on their phones. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, the committee chair opened the discussion to other comments. A few people praised the committee for its work and expressed a clear rationale for which course should complete the major requirements. A consensus quickly became evident, with enthusiastic nodding around the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Franklin was not convinced. &#x201c;Look, I think this is a huge mistake,&#x201d; he said, interrupting the next speaker. &#x201c;You are all going to wish you had stopped this second major when you had the chance,&#x201d; at which he defiantly picked up his iPad and tuned out for the rest of the meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two weeks later, a senior professorship opened just above the level occupied by both Franklin and Joe. It was Joe who received the promotion.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Jennifer is a successful statistician who works at a federally funded research center that is testing new cancer drugs. By age thirty-five, she already had become the director of her unit at the institute and the president of a national professional society for statisticians, and she had even been invited to the White House as a member of an expert panel. She also is deeply in love with her wife of fifteen years, an oncologist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Jennifer is not happy. In fact, on many days she&#x2019;s pretty down on herself. Even though she knows she is doing well professionally, she just can&#x2019;t shake the feeling that she is somehow inferior to her colleagues. The same despondency affects her relationships. Her wife often tells her how much she loves her, but Jennifer feels as if she is incessantly being judged and criticized. Even with friends or coworkers, she senses that everyone has made plans but excluded her. <i>Everyone is just so arrogant</i>, she would think. <i>They&#x2019;re no better than me</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, when Jennifer was recruited to lead a team on a new high-profile grant in North Carolina&#x2019;s Research Triangle, she was more than happy to move. She chose a little neighborhood in Chapel Hill called Southern Village. Ever the statistician, she loved how this community had been developed based on modern urban planning research. The constellation of apartments, town houses, and single-family homes, which collectively encircled an old-fashioned town square, was designed to foster community engagement and social interaction. The urban planning principles seemed to work&#x2014;the town square indeed became a hub of almost utopian friendly exchange, like a scene from <i>The Truman Show</i>. On the first Wednesday of each month, the neighborhood sponsored a dog parade. On Friday evenings, the community assembled on the green in the center of the square to watch movies and share a picnic dinner. <i>This is just the place to feel at home</i>, Jennifer thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But after six years there, not much had changed for her. Jennifer still listened to her coworkers make happy-hour plans, but she was not invited. When she went to the green on movie nights, she resented that everyone who came by talked more to her wife than to her. And she was particularly annoyed every morning by the sight of the neighbors who would stand at the foot of her driveway chatting with one another. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I ever did to them,&#x201d; she once told me, &#x201c;but they never ask me to go running, or to yoga, or anything&#x2014;even if I am standing right next to them!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Alan is forty-six years old and has a weakness for pie. He has a very nice office in downtown Sunnyville but he hadn&#x2019;t been at his desk all week. Instead, he sat in the last booth at the local diner to catch the view from the huge bay window right next to his table. On a clear day, this was an ideal spot to see the whole shopping district downtown, and on this particular afternoon, he had covered not only his table but the one next to it with file folders, Post-its, and empty cups of coffee strategically placed on top of papers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one at Sunnyville Diner seemed to mind. One of the waitresses, Lateesha, waved at him when she began her shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The day hasn&#x2019;t really begun until I see you!&#x201d; Alan called out. Lateesha smiled while playfully holding a dish towel over her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Donna, the hostess who had recently separated from her husband, came to his table, he held her hand in both of his and asked, &#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the chef gave him a nod and a smile as he walked tothe front of the diner. &#x201c;Best pie yet!&#x201d; Alan told him with his mouth full.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At about 5 p.m., Alan was greeted by Mike, a colleague from his former real estate development firm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, looks like you&#x2019;ve moved in,&#x201d; Mike joked. &#x201c;Working on a pitch?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup, north side of town. Ten acres, mixed-use&nbsp; development, plus a new hotel,&#x201d; Alan replied, pointing to the coffee cup at the edge of the table. As Mike questioned him about the project, Alan used a laser pointer to trace the perimeter of the property, the stream that would cut through it, and the new set of apartments, marked by a sugar dispenser in the middle of the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mike hadn&#x2019;t blinked in at least a minute as he listened to Alan&#x2019;s plan and finally shook his head. &#x201c;You have no fear, man. The northside? Really? Here in Sunnyville? You know they turned us down when we pitched there last year. &#x2018;This generation will never see development in that part of town,&#x2019; they told us. Good luck, you&#x2019;re going to need it!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alan&#x2019;s presentation to the town council lasted over three hours. And for most of it, things did not look good. Just fifteen minutes into his presentation, two council members interrupted him to say that they were simply not going to be able to support the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a sound investment for Sunnyville,&#x201d; one of them asserted. &#x201c;The implications for the traffic and road repair alone are far too substantial to seriously consider any type of mixed-use development in that part of town.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Alan persisted, armed with graphs, town records from the archives, and the testimony of experts from nearby properties he had developed who were ready to comment on his successful track record. But mostly,Alan had a patient, nondefensive, and unwaveringly enthusiastic demeanor as he calmly described every detail of the planned development. When his estimate ofthe project&#x2019;s finances was disputed, he smiled, took a step back, and walked his inquisitor through his figures. When the town council members challenged his ideas for possible commercial uses of the property, Alan was firm, but open-minded. When they questioned his proposed timeline, he made a joke and agreed with their assessment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By 9 p.m., the council members were ready to allow questions from the town&#x2019;s residents in attendance. One spoke critically of the proposal and also shouted an insult directly at Alan. He took it in stride, even self-effacingly. When other citizens praised him, he was modest, and when they embarrassed themselves with incomprehensible questions, he rescued their dignity. Finally, after thirty minutes of discussion, it was time for a vote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal passed unanimously. The onlookers applauded as Alan closed the biggest deal of his career. Many were excited about the changes coming to their town. But as some shook his hand to congratulate him, it almost seemed as if they were rooting more for Alan than the proposal itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After everyone left, Alan remained in his chair for a few moments, in stunned disbelief. Mike had witnessed the entire meeting and now walked over to offer his own congratulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am so glad I pulled those old town records,&#x201d; Alan said. &#x201c;I think that may be what got them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mike shook his head and patted his friend on the back. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the records,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the experts, and it wasn&#x2019;t even the breaks you offered them. We did all of that last year, and they never agreed to a single proposal. It was <i>you</i>, man. They didn&#x2019;t vote for the project, they voted for <i>you</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Everyone knows a story like these. Some of our coworkers and neighbors are consistently successful, and not for the reasons we might expect, while others don&#x2019;t get their way no matter how hard they try. We also all have peers who feel excluded in every context, while others have mysterious confidence and consistent social success. We may think we left the mores of high school behind us, but popularity is still very much a part of the adult playground. It is that one factor that no one really talks about, yet it makes a big difference in our lives. Popularity dynamics affect our careers, our success in meeting our goals, our personal and professional relationships, and ultimately our happiness.<br>The ongoing importance of popularity in adulthood was a surprise even to me, until I learned a lesson from my own students.<br>In August 2001, something strange was taking place on the campus of Yale University.

Shipped off to fight in a war he knew nothing about, he found himself in a world of violence, fear, heat, and squalor unlike anything that he ever dreamed could exist. <p>Told in the unflinchingly accurate language of the field soldier--fast, rough slang that becomes a kind of surreal poetry--CLOSE QUARTERS is the story of Dosier's year in Vietnam. </p><p>"An unremittingly honest look into the black pit of war...[Larry Heinemann's] voice is clear and true." (The New York Times)</p></p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesFrom the moment his first novel was published, Larry Heinemann joined the ranks of the great chroniclers of the Vietnam conflict--Philip Caputo, Tim O'Brien, and Gustav Hasford. <br>In the stripped-down, unsullied patois of an ordinary soldier, draftee Philip Dosier tells the story of his war. Straight from high school, too young to vote or buy himself a drink, he enters a world of mud and heat, blood and body counts, ambushes and firefights. It is here that he embarks on the brutal downward path to wisdom that awaits every soldier. In the tradition of Naked and the Dead and The Thin Red Line, Close Quarters is the harrowing story of how a decent kid from Chicago endures an extraordinary trial-- and returns profoundly altered to a world on the threshold of change.</p><h2>Apollo 13</h2><p>A children&#39;s novelization of a film starring Tom Hanks. In the 13th minute of the 13th hour of the 13th day, the Apollo 13 mission to the Moon is doing well - until it hits disaster. The three astronauts now face the grim possibility that they might never return to Earth.</p><p>On April 13, 1970, three American astronauts were on their way to the moon when a mysterious explosion rocked their ship, forcing them to abandon the main ship and spend four days in the tiny lunar module which was intended to support two men for two days. A harrowing story of danger, courage and brilliant off-the-cuff engineering solutions which resulted in a dramatic rescue.On April 13, 1970, astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were hurtling along in the Apollo 13 spacecraft, on America's fifth mission to the moon, when a mysterious explosion rocked the ship. The cockpit grew dim, the air grew thin, and the instrument lights winked out. Moments later, the astronauts were forced to abandon the main for the tiny lunar module, designed to keep two men alive for just two days. But there were now three men aboard, and they were four days from home. As the action shifts from the disabled ship to the frantic engineers at Mission Control to Lovell's anxious family, <i>Apollo 13</i> brilliantly recreates the harrowing, heroic rescue mission in all its drama and glory.</p><h2>Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power</h2><p>In 1959, twenty-nine-year-old Berry Gordy, who had already given up on his dream to be a champion boxer, borrowed eight hundred dollars from his family and started a record company. A run-down bungalow sandwiched between a funeral home and a beauty shop in a poor Detroit neighborhood served as his headquarters. The building&#x2019;s entrance was adorned with a large sign that improbably boasted &#x201c;Hitsville U.S.A.&#x201d; The kitchen served as the control room, the garage became the two-track studio, the living room was reserved for bookkeeping, and sales were handled in the dining room. Soon word spread that any youngster with a streak of talent should visit the only record label that Detroit had seen in years. The company&#x2019;s name was Motown.<br>Motown cuts through decades of unsubstantiated rumors and speculation to tell the true behind-the-scenes narrative of America&#x2019;s most exciting musical dynasty. It follows the company and its amazing roster of stars from the tumultuous growth years in Detroit, to the drama and intrigue of Hollywood in the 1970s, to resurgence in 2002.<br>Set against the civil rights movement, the decay of America&#x2019;s northern industrial cities, and the social upheaval of the 1960s, Motown is a tale of the incredible entrepreneurship of Berry Gordy. But it also features the moving stories of kids from Detroit&#x2019;s inner-city projects who achieved remarkable success and then, in many cases, found themselves fighting the demons that so often come with stardom&#x2014;drugs, jealousy, sexual indulgence, greed, and uncontrollable ambition. <br>Motown features an extraordinary cast of characters, including Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Stevie Wonder. They are presented as they lived and worked: a clan of friends, lovers, competitors, and sometimes vicious foes. Motown reveals how the hopes and dreams of each affected the lives of the others and illustrates why this singular story is a made-in-America Greek tragedy, the rise and fall of a supremely talented yet completely dysfunctional extended family. <br>Based on numerous original interviews and extensive documentation, Motown benefits particularly from the thousands of pages of files crammed into the basement of downtown Detroit&#x2019;s Wayne County Courthouse. Those court records provide the unofficial&#x2014;and hitherto largely untold&#x2014;history of Motown and its stars, since almost every relationship between departing singers, songwriters, producers, and the label ended up in litigation. <br>From its peaks in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Motown controlled the pop charts and its stars were sought after even by the Beatles, through the inexorable slide caused by their failure to handle their stardom, Motown is a riveting and troubling look inside a music label that provided the unofficial soundtrack to an entire generation.</p><p>The book that answers the questions about the Motown nobody knows . . .<br>ï¿½ Is there any truth to the rumor that the Mafia grabbed control of Motown after Berry Gordy ran afoul of violent loan sharks? <br>ï¿½ Which Motown diva was almost run down by a station wagon after a blowout with a rival? <br>ï¿½ How did Hollywood and the film industry sink Motown&#x2019;s film business after the tremendous promise of Lady Sings the Blues?<br>ï¿½ What famous star hid from Gordy that he was the father of her first child? <br>ï¿½ What was the secret scheme one former executive says the company developed to steal millions of dollars in &#x201c;suitcases of cash&#x201d; from artists and songwriters? <br>ï¿½ Which Motown star had a violent fight with Gordy on the day JFK was assassinated? <br>ï¿½ Was the death of the Temptations&#x2019; Paul Williams by a single gunshot a suicide, as ruled by coroners, or a murder to silence him, as suspected by some colleagues?Gerald Posner, a former Wall Street lawyer, is an award-winning author of seven books on subjects ranging from Nazi war criminals, to assassinations, to the lives and careers of politicians.

Original.</p><p>Wow! Washington, D.C.! Ms. Rooney's whole class gets to go on a two-day trip to the nation's capital. They'll see all kinds of great sights -- the Washington Monument, the National A rand Space Museum, the zoo, and lots more Emily Arrow can hardly wait.<p>But when the day of the trip comes, things don't turn out right for Emily. She gets stuck with a yucko partner. Not only that, but she's forgotten something very important. How will she ever have fun on this trip?</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of surprises in store for Emily and the rest of the Polk Street Kids that make this trip an unforgettable one. Plus, at the end of the story there's a kids' guide to all the best museums, government buildings, monuments, and other sights in Washington, D.C.</p>Grade 2-4?In this continuing saga of the children from Polk Street School, the class is taking a trip to Washington, D.C. During the trip, Emily comes to realize that a generally unpopular classmate has some positive traits; in fact, he turns out to be a good friend. Along with the story, Giff offers a quick tour of the sites. She also includes a section of very brief descriptions of the students' favorite things to see, along with addresses and phone numbers. Even with the present closing of roads in the city and some errors, such as calling the Tomb of the Unknowns by its former name, this is a fun introduction for youngsters making their first trip to the nation's capital. Shirley Climo's City! Washington, D.C. (Macmillan, 1991) and Catherine Reef's Washington, D.C. (Dillon, 1990) are for older audiences and deal with history rather than just having a good time looking around.

In 1918 came the brief moment when the victorious Allies at the Versailles Conference had the opportunity - by means of a peace with justice - to set up democracy in central Europe. The Kings Depart tells of their failure; of the Allies&#39; rapacity which drove a ruined Germany to seek vengeance; of Germany&#39;s terrible collapse into anarchy and Red revolution and her even more frightful salvation at the hands of the army and the Freikorps; of the appearance of the swastika banner and right-wing terrorists and adventurers awaiting their Fuhrer.</p><p>Richard M Watt is the author of DARE CALL IT TREASON, a widely acclaimed history of the French Army mutinies in 1917.

It is, in that sense, a love story, but in the hands of Virginia Woolf, it transcends conventional romance to pose a series of crucial questions about women, intellectual freedom, and marriage.<br></p><p>The edition is intended for literary scholars and students with an interest in Virginia Woolf, modernist literature, women&#39;s writing, and the history of the novel in the twentieth century. It is more thorough than any previous edition, as regards textual variants, explanatory notes, and the Introduction.Night and Day, Virginia Woolf&#39;s second novel, is both a love story and a social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen; yet it also questions that tradition, recognizing that the goals of society and the individual may not necessarily coincide. At its centre is Katharine Hilbery, the beautiful grand-daughter of a great Victorian poet. She must choose between becoming engaged to the oddly prosaic poet William Rodney and her attraction to Ralph Denham, with whom she feels a more profound and disturbing affinity. Katharine&#39;s hesitation is vividly contrasted with the approach of her friend Mary Datchet, dedicated to the Women&#39;s Rights movement. The ensuing complications are underlined and to some extent unravelled by Katharine&#39;s mother, Mrs Hilbery, whose struggles to weave together the known documents, events and memories of her father&#39;s life into a coherent biography reflect Woolf&#39;s own sense of the unique and elusive nature of experience.</p><h2>The Swimming Pool</h2><p>&#39;I can&#39;t take my eyes off the water. Can you?&#39; It&#39;s summer when Elm Hill lido opens, having stood empty for years. For Natalie Steele - wife, mother, teacher - it offers freedom from the tightly controlled routines of work and family. Especially when it leads her to Lara Channing, a charismatic former actress with a lavish bohemian lifestyle, who seems all too happy to invite Natalie into her elite circle. Soon Natalie is spending long days at the pool, socializing with new friends and basking in a popularity she didn&#39;t know she&#39;d been missing. Real life, and the person she used to be, begins to feel very far away. But is such a change in fortunes too good to be true? Why are dark memories of a summer long ago now threatening to surface?

Few regions pack such a variety of trails into an area crossable by a two-hour drive. This guide covers more than just the well-known Three Sisters, Mt. Jefferson, and Diamond Peak Wilderness Areas. You'll discover paths to a natural rock arch near Detroit, a cluster of lava caves near Bend, a dry waterfall on the McKenzie River, and a gold-mining ghost town near Cottage Grove. Twenty-three of the trips are open even in winter. <p>This guidebook features several difficulty levels. Hikers with children will find 50 hikes carefully chosen for them. On the other hand, a quarter of the hikes included are unabashedly difficult, and 56 of the trails are rated as suitable for backpackers as well as day hikers. Special symbols identify trails recommended for mountain bikers and equestrians. At the back of the book you'll find a list of 20 all-accessible trails suitable for strollers and wheelchairs. And if you really want to get away from it all, there's even an appendix describing 100 MORE hikes in the Central Oregon Cascades -- little known but interesting paths for adventurous spirits.</p></p><p>William L. Sullivan is the author of six books and numerous articles about Oregon, including a regular outdoor column for Eugene Weekly. A fifth-generation Oregonian, Sullivan began hiking at the age of five and has been exploring new trails ever since. After receiving an English degree from Cornell University and studying at Germany's Heidelberg University, he earned an M.A. from the University of Oregon. <p>In 1985 Sullivan set out to investigate Oregon's wilderness on a 1,361-mile solo backpacking trek from the state's westernmost shore at Cape Blanco to Oregon's easternmost point in Hells Canyon. His journal of that two-month adventure, published as "Listening for Coyote," was a finalist for the Oregon Book Award in creative nonfiction . Since then he has authored a popular series of "100 Hikes" guidebooks to the regions of Oregon. Other titles in the series are "100 Hikes in Northwest Oregon," covering Mt. Hood, the Columbia Gorge, Mt. St. Helens, and the Portland area; "100 Hikes in Southern Oregon," including Crater Lake National Park, the Rogue River, the Siskiyous, the Trinity Alps, and Mt. Shasta; and "100 Hikes/Travel Guide: Oregon Coast &amp; Coast Range," describing not only the hiking trails of the scenic Pacific shore, but also the campgrounds, beaches, lighthouses, aquariums, canoeing/kayaking options, bicycle paths, and birdwatching sites. </p><p>He and his wife Janell live in Eugene, but spend summers in a log cabin they built by hand on a roadless stretch of Oregon's Siletz River.</p>Hike #4. Opal Creek Easy (to Opal Pool) 7 miles round-trip 200 feet elevation gain Open all year Maps: Battle Ax, Elkhorn (USGS) <p>Moderate (to Beachie Creek) 10.2 miles round-trip 500 feet elevation gain </p><p>Opal Creek's ancient forest, on the edge of the Bull of the Woods Wilderness, was thrust to fame in the 1980s by controversy over Forest Service logging proposals. National television crews and thousands of visitors hiked to Jawbone Flats' rustic mining camp and scrambled over a rugged "bear trail" to view the endangered old-growth groves towering above this creek's green pools. By the time Opal Creek finally won Wilderness protection in 1996 an improved path had been built to make the area more hiker-friendly. The new trail shortcuts from the Little North Santiam River to Opal Creek, bypassing Jawbone Flats. </p><p>Start by driving east from Salem on North Santiam Highway 22 for 23 miles to Mehama's second flashing yellow light. Opposite the Swiss Village Restaurant, turn left on Little North Fork Road for 15 paved miles and an additional 1.3 miles of gravel. At a fork, veer left on Road 2209 past the sign "Road Closed 6 Miles Ahead." Then drive 6 miles to the locked gate. Residents of Jawbone Flats are allowed to drive the dirt road ahead; others must park and walk. </p><p>The pleasantly primitive road crosses Gold Creek on a 60-foot-high bridge, skirts dramatic cliffs above the Little North Santiam River, and winds through an old-growth grove as impressive as any found farther upstream. At the 2-mile mark, stop to inspect the rusting machinery of Merten Mill on the right. The mill operated briefly during the Depression, using winches from the battleship USS Oregon, but folded after two of the mill's lumber trucks fell off the narrow canyon road. Now a camping area for backpackers, the mill site has one small empty building that can serve as emergency shelter. A short side trail behind the building leads to Sawmill Falls, a 30-foot cascade pouring into a deep green pool ideal for swimming. </p><p>The road forks 0.2 mile beyond Merten Mill, offering two options. Day hikers interested in the area's mining history may wish to continue straight on the main road 1.3 miles to Jawbone Flats, a well-preserved collection of 27 buildings dating from 1929-1932. Jawbone Flats has been donated to the Friends of Opal Creek as an old-growth study center. Respect the residents' privacy by staying on the road. Cross a bridge, turn right at a building with a humming water-power generator, and walk 0.2 mile further to a sign indicating a short side trail to Opal Pool's scenic gorge&lt;197&gt;a rewarding goal for an easy hike. </p><p>If you're headed for the trail up Opal Creek, however, don't go to Jawbone Flats. Instead, turn right at the road fork beyond Merten Mill, cross the river on an old log bridge, and turn left onto the Opal Creek Trail. The path follows the Little North Santiam River a mile, crosses a forested bench to an overlook of Opal Pool, and then continues up Opal Creek 1.5 miles before petering out. Along the way you'll pass several small waterfalls and Cedar Flat's trio of ancient red cedars, 500-1000 years old. The Beachie Creek crossing, on a mossy log, makes a good turnaround point.</p></p><h2>Celebrate Autumn</h2><p>Everyone who loves crisp days and bright fall colors will cherish <b>Celebrate Autumn</b>!

The cool morning light sparkles on frosty meadows and every apple, squash and tomato has reached the peak of ripeness. According to Keats, it's the "season of mists and mellow fruitfulness," and we embrace it as we would an old friend, steadfast and true.<br><br> We celebrate harvest with family and friends, immersing ourselves in the sounds and rituals of the season...the brisk snap of a football, the rustle of raked leaves, the aroma of a freshly-baked apple pie, the crackle of a fireside campout, the cheerful glow of marshmallows on a stick. On Thanksgiving we feast on a fat, roasted turkey and remember our pioneer spirit.<br><br> Part of autumn's beauty is that it cannot last forever.

Anita Diamant, the author of six books about contemporary Jewish life and two novels, is a prizewinning journalist whose work has appeared regularly in <i>The Boston Globe Magazine</i> and <i>Parenting.</i> <i>The Red Tent,</i> her first novel, was named Book Sense Book of the Year. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband.<p><b>Introduction</b> </p><p> Before <i>The Red Tent,</i> before <i>Good Harbor,</i> before and during six books on contemporary Jewish life, I was a columnist. </p><p> I wrote essays about friendship and fashion, about marriage and electoral politics, about abortion, lingerie, situation comedies, birth, death, God, country, and my dog. I covered the waterfront and the supermarket, my synagogue, the waiting room outside the intensive care unit, and my own kitchen table. </p><p> I did this over the course of twenty years for publications that included a weekly newspaper with a mostly twenty-something readership, and later for a Sunday-magazine audience of millions. I wrote for food lovers in a New England magazine, for the parents of young children in a national publication, and for an international Jewish audience in an on-line magazine. Most of the time, my assignment was weekly; sometimes, it was monthly. </p><p> My job was to report on the events of the day and the changes under my own roof. The challenge was to pay closer-than-average attention and then shape my experiences and reactions into entertaining prose that rose above the level of my own navel. It was more than a great job -- it was a meaningful job. </p><p> This collection, culled from those publications and years, turns out to be a sort of diary. It includes musings about the contents of my refrigerator as well as reflections about the most important decisions of my life. To divorce and marry again. To have a child. To live a Jewish life. </p><p> I suppose it's a measure of how much the world has changed that what once seemed like "edgy" choices now seem fairly mainstream. But at the time, I was thinking and doing things that were simply unimaginable for women at any other period in human history. Having been born female, white, and middle class in the United States, in the middle of the twentieth century, meant the women's movement happened to me, in me, for me. It meant that it was highly unlikely that I would die in childbirth, and it meant that I could teach my daughter to speak in her own voice. It meant I could love my work and love my family. And it meant that there was an audience for what I had to say about the trials and joys of this girl's life. </p><p> Actually, the audience was the great, unexpected gift of the assignment because they wrote back. A few said, "No way," and "How dare you?" But many more said, "Me, too," and "Thanks." </p><p> We connected -- my readers and I -- because we were trying something entirely new. We were not just tinkering around the edges, adjusting our "roles" as women and men. We were reinventing the female psyche and soul, which of course required a radical recasting of the male. We're still at it, too, and with more confidence, wisdom, and resources every year. That our daughters and sons are blasï¿½ about this transformation is a measure of our success. </p><p> Looking back through these essays, reflecting on the reflections, is a lot like leafing through the family photo album. I stop and exclaim over the difference between my daughter then (kindergarten) and my daughter now (college). The changes in me are not quite as photogenic, but I think I've become kinder and more patient. I sure hope so. </p><p> My tent is filled with friends and songs and books and memories. My tent -- and I hope yours, too -- is filled with blessings. Come see. </p><p> Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by Anita Diamant</p></p><h2>The Seventy Great Journeys in History</h2><p><b>The adventurous stories of the greatest explorers in history, illustrated with hundreds of evocative portraits, photographs, paintings, and maps.</b><br><br>Marco Polo, Ferdinand Magellan, David Livingstone, Amelia Earhart, Neil Armstrong: these are some of the greatest travelers of all time. This book chronicles their stories and many more, describing epic voyages of discovery and exploration, from the extraordinary migrations out of Africa by our earliest ancestors to the latest voyages into space.<br><br>In antiquity, we follow Alexander the Great to the Indus and Hannibal across the Alps; in medieval times we trek beside Genghis Khan and Ibn Battuta. The Renaissance brought Columbus to the Americas and the circumnavigation of the world. The following centuries saw gaps in the global maps filled by Tasman, Bering, and Cook, and journeys made for scientific purposes, most famously by von Humboldt and Darwin. In modern times, the last inhospitable ends of the earth were reached&#x2014;including both poles and the world's highest mountain&#x2014;and new elements were conquered.<br><br>Here are human stories of great triumph and success, but also of terrible hardships, tragedy, and astonishing courage in adversity. An incredible team of contributors&#x2014;from distinguished historians and writers to travelers and explorers&#x2014;bring firsthand experience to the journeys and places they describe.<br><br> The contributors include Robert Ballard, Barry Cunliffe, Ranulph Fiennes, Pen Hadow, John Hemming, Robin Knox-Johnston, Christopher Ondaatje, and Simon Winchester. 398 illustrations, 320 in color.</p><p><b>Robin Hanbury-Tenison</b> is a well-known explorer, author, and conservationist. He made the first land crossing of South America at its widest point, and the first river crossing of South America from north to south from the Orinoco to Buenos Aires.Proceeding chronologically from ancient Africa to space age pioneering, this illustrated volume contains tales of exploration selected by author and conservationist Hanbury-Tenison (The Oxford Book of Exploration) for their "epic quality" and "impact through the ages." In entries no more than five pages long, readers travel along such well-known routes as St. Paul's trek from Jerusalem to Rome, Marco Polo's 5,600 mile journey across Asia, the voyages of Columbus, Magellan's ill-fated global circumnavigation, Lewis and Clark's exploration of the American West, Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic and the first manned mission to the moon. Along the way, there's a tale of 52-year-old scientist Maria Sibylla Merian facing the considerable dangers of Surinam; the meeting of Stanley and Livingstone in the heart of Africa; and the undersea exploration of improbably life-sustaining lava seams. Included among the triumphs are tragic journeys such as the 1838 Trail of Tears, and the legions of sea captains who fought unsuccessfully to find the Northwest Passage. Each overview is accompanied by plenty of full-color photos, illustrations and maps, and occasionally bolstered by telling quotes, including this from balloonist Bertrand Piccard in 1999: "The way the public sees it is this. If we ... don't succeed in our mission we are incompetent. But if we do succeed it's because anyone could have done it."

In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig, stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth. Eight hundred years earlier, on the eve of a brutal crusade that will rip apart southern France, a young woman named Alais is given a ring and a mysterious book for safekeeping by her father. The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail. Now, as crusading armies gather outside the city walls of Carcassonne, it will take a tremendous sacrifice to keep the secret of the labyrinth safe.</p><p>Kate Mosse is the cofounder and honorary director of the prestigious Orange Prize for Fiction.

Night of the Wolf looked back even further in time, to the days of Julius Caesar, when a woman's beauty bewitched a wolf&#x2014;and awakened the man who had been slumbering for millennia in the beast's savage heart . . . a man named Maeniel, who would become Regeane's soul mate. Now Borchardt takes the saga of these two extraordinary lovers to dazzling new heights of the imagination. The result is a novel of which the pages ring with magic, romance, and adventure&#x2014;an irresistible call to everything wild within us.<br><br>The armies of Charlemagne are poised in Geneva, ready to add Italy to their lord's growing list of conquests. On the other side of the Alps, the mercenary forces of the corrupt King Desiderus watch the mountain passes like cats crouched impatiently before the holes of mice. Lying between the two camps is a wild and forbidding land where shapeshifters live unmolested, protected by their leader, Maeniel, and his bride, Regeane. But now the wars of men threaten to undo the careful work of centuries. The human part of Maeniel owes fealty to Charlemagne. But the wolf acknowledges no master.<br><br>Still, it is as both wolf and man that Maeniel embarks on a hazardous mission for Charlemagne. Captured, Maeniel is condemned to death twice over, as a spy and as a demon changeling. Now, with the help of a Saxon warrior whose love poses dangers of its own, Regeane will brave the icy crags and crevices of the Alps to rescue her husband, only to find that he is the bait in a trap set for her by a villainous man from her darkest past&#x2014;a man who will stop at nothing to gain the vengeance of which he dreams.<br><br>But there is another enemy at work. Behind the tangle of ambitions and animosities driving kings and commoners alike, an ancient evil thirsts for a revenge of its own: a revenge that demands the blood of Maeniel and <br>Regeane . . . and of all humanity.</p><p>Alice Borchardt writes at least as well as her sister does--and her sister is Anne Rice. <i>The Wolf King</i> is the third in her series of alternate history novels with shape-shifting protagonists, following <i>The Silver Wolf</i> and <i>Night of the Wolf</i>. Reading the first two adds to the reader's understanding of the characters, though it's not required.<p> Borchardt mixes fantasy, horror, romance, suspense, action-adventure, political intrigue, and realistic evocation of Italy in the late eighth century. She uses lyrical descriptive passages to set scenes and immerse the reader in her characters' experiences. When a runaway Saxon slave rescues Regeane, the silver wolf, from a deadly blizzard, "the wind was howling around him and the world was sinking into a cold, gray blueness as the sun set somewhere beyond the clouds." He wraps her in his flea-harboring bearskin, reflecting that "this girl didn't have nearly the healthy temperature he did; maybe the little bastards would die. At any rate, the extermination of his vermin companions was the only benefit he was likely to derive from this particular adventure." He's wrong about that.</p><p> Regeane is Maeniel's mate (he's the long-lived werewolf leader of the pack, whose earlier life was featured in <i>Night of the Wolf</i>). Once thawed, Regeane confronts a demented abbot and a gang of (literal) cutthroats to save him. The werewolves and the Saxon head for Geneva to pledge allegiance to Charlemagne, who's about to cross the Alps to challenge King Desederius of the Lombards for control of northern and central Italy.</p><p> Soon Maeniel is in Desederius's territory and in danger. Regeane follows, despite his prohibition. They're fated to reencounter Regeane's sniveling cousin Hugo, who seeks revenge. He has become host to a powerful bear spirit who wants the wolves for his own purposes. The new Hugo has a lot in common with the Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin character in <i>All of Me</i>; he provides comic leavening to the sometimes grim action. Other returning characters include Pope Hadrian's tough, practical, but vulnerable mistress Lucilla; her protï¿½gï¿½, the singer Dulcinia; and the ageless werewolf earth-mother Matrona.</p><p> <i>The Wolf King</i>'s almost-too-rich plot lines, characters, and mixed Teutonic, Roman, and Christian mythic elements may overwhelm those new to Borchardt's alternate Dark Ages. The story also ends abruptly--leaving plenty of room for sequels. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>The armies of Charlemagne are poised to conquer Italy.

She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.Skillfully combining the rich history of Native Americans with their life in the 21st century, bestseller Coel offers a fresh story that moves as fast as the moccasin telegraph, the reservation gossip line that spreads news faster than the Internet, in this eighth outing featuring Vicky Holden, Arapaho attorney, and Father John O'Malley, priest of the mission on Wyoming's Wind River Reservation. This represents a welcome return to form after last year's The Thunder Keeper, which suffered from an overly familiar plot. Father John is facing the possible closing of the mission and the sudden disappearance of one of his parishioners when Vicky's ex-husband is murdered and she becomes the chief suspect. Circumstances prompt Vicky to forgo Father John's assistance in her search for the killer, but as they go their separate ways, they each struggle to clarify their feelings for each other. In due course their paths cross at the ranch where James Sherwood, called Orlando by his followers, has resurrected the Shadow Dance religion of the 1890s. Can Sherwood deliver on his promise of an Indian paradise? Compared to and praised by Tony Hillerman, Coel not only presents a vivid and authentic picture of the Native American, past and present, but also captures the rugged and majestic atmosphere of Wyoming. Even minor characters are real and human. The poignant ending will catch even the most astute mystery aficionado by surprise.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Palm Beach Houses</h2><p>This classic volume, now back in print in a new format and at a reduced price, offers a strikingly illustrated, extensively researched history of Palm&nbsp; &#xfeff;In 1894, Palm Beach leaped to world prominence as a winter playground with the completion of Henry Morrison Flagler&#x2019;s Royal Poinciana Hotel.

Crosby (B.A. and M.A. University of Iowa; Ph.D., Stanford University) was Writing Supervisor of the Rhetoric Program at the University of Iowa, Chairman of the Department of Rhetoric at Boston University, and Director of the Writing Center at Harvard University. Crosby now edits the 100th Bomb Group Newsletter.An affecting, ambivalent memoir from an Army Air Force veteran who survived the savage aerial engagements of WW II's ETO. Lead navigator in the 100th Bomb Group, which sustained staggering casualties at the Luftwaffe's hands, Crosby was responsible for guiding flotillas of UK-based B-17s to targets throughout occupied Europe. An archetypal straight arrow from mid- America, the well-educated and happily married author had little use for daredevils, drunks, goldbricks, lady-killers, or anyone else who treated combat as a less-than-serious business. Nor did he much appreciate the USAAF's bent for giving pilots preference (over bombardiers or pathfinders) on promotions, decorations, and command billets. Crosby provides a vivid account of what life was like on and off the flight line in East Anglia, as well as in the unfriendly skies above the Continent, where his notable accomplishments were matched by his hairbreadth escapes. During his extended tour, for example, he directed missions against objectives so remote that the raiders had to land in Africa or Russia rather than return to their home fields. On another occasion, his plane, badly damaged by flak, was obliged to shoot down ten German fighters to make it back for a crash landing on British soil. As his squadron lost men and machines, the high cost of conflict became an increasingly grave concern for Crosby. The author soldiered on, however, and he recalls now the relief he felt when Flying Fortresses began delivering food supplies (not ordnance) to the long-suffering people of liberated countries. In a low-key epilogue, he discloses that, though a regular attendee at his outfit's reunions, he turned actively anti-war during the 1960's. Uncommonly thoughtful recollections that address the moral ambiguities of a great cause without in any way denigrating the selfless valor or camaraderie that helped ennoble it.

Their captors were Arab and German terrorists, aided by the Ugandan army; their liberators were members of Israel&#39;s elite commando unit, Sayeret Matkal, simply known as &#34;the Unit.&#34; Lt.-Col. Yoni (Jonathan) Netanyahu, the Unit&#39;s commander, earned world-wide fame in the wake of the operation&#39;s stunning success. He was the only Israeli soldier killed in the Entebbe raid. As a brother of the rescue force&#39;s commander, and himself a member of the Unit, Iddo Netanyahu had ready access to the participants in the raid. He was able to obtain detailed accounts from the men of the Unit who, for the first time, described the planning and preparations for the mission and its near-perfect execution. What emerged from their accounts is a powerful and stirring story of how the daring undertaking was accomplished after only 48 hours of frantic preparations. Yoni&#39;s Last Battle portrays the men who carried out an incredibly hazardous operation in far-away Africa. Above all, it depicts the heroic - and tragic - figure of their commander, Yoni.</p><p>Iddo Netanyahu was born in Jerusalem, Israel. After graduating from high school in the United States, where he spent part of his childhood, he returned to Israel. There he enlisted in the elite commando unit that his older brother Jonathan was to lead to Entebbe in 1976. It was during his studies at The Hebrew University School of Medicine that Netanyahu began his career as an author of short stories, novels and political articles. He divides his time between writing and working as a physician. Netanyahu lives in Jerusalem with his wife and two children.Originally published in Hebrew in 1991, this book has been reissued in English to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Entebbe raid. In June 1976, an Air France jetliner was hijacked and forced to fly to Entebbe, Uganda, by terrorists. On July 4, 30 soldiers of the Israeli army known as &#34;the Unit&#34; successfully rescued over 100 Israeli and Jewish passengers held captive by the terrorists. Only the 30-year-old commander of the unit, Lt. Col. Jonathan (Yoni) Netanyahu, was killed. He was the brother of the author, who also participated in the raid, along with a third brother, Benjamin Netanyahu (later to become prime minister of Israel). The book is both an accurate, detailed account of the raid and a personal tribute to a brother and a hero. The fast-paced text offers numerous flashbacks of the three brothers&#39; childhood and army service. Although some details and identities remain classified, the author was able to interview most of the unit&#39;s soldiers and others involved in the raid. This new edition contains transcripts of those interviews. The book lacks an index, but photos, drawings, and personal recollections assist in explaining this historical event.

The night before his mother left, Mike Sullivan sat next to her in the front pew of St. Stephen's. At least twice a week, when they needed a place to hide, they would come here, and after praying, if she had some extra money, they'd head over to the Strand, Belham's downtown movie theater where three bucks got you back-to-back James Bond movies. Most of the time they'd head over to the public library where his mother would check out her weekly fix of paperback romance books, all of them with titles like <i>The Taming of Chastity Wellington</i> and <i>Miss Sofia's Secret.</i><br><br>It was the snow that had driven them back inside the church that night. They had been on their way home from the library when the light snow suddenly turned bad, the wind howling so hard that Mike wondered if the car would tip over. Traffic was backed up everywhere, so they pulled into St. Stephen's to wait out the storm. Belham was still shoveling out from last month's whopper, the Blizzard of '78; now, not even a month later, a weatherman on the radio was predicting another storm for northeastern Massachusetts. Mike was eight.<br><br>The church was packed with people waiting for the roads to be cleared. His mother picked up one of the three travel magazines she had checked out from the library and started to read, her face serious but relaxed, the way she looked when she prayed. She was a petite woman, so small that Mike would tightly clasp his hands around hers, afraid that if he didn't somehow keep her anchored to the ground, she'd blow away. She flipped a page in her magazine, her free hand caressing the beautiful silk blue scarf she wore around her neck, the scarf imprinted with ancient pillars and statues and angels and looking completely out of place against her bulky winter jacket.<br><br>"It's rude to stare, Michael," she said in a soft voice. Even when she was mad, which was hardly ever, her voice stayed that way.<br><br>"I don't have anything to read," he whispered. "How come the library doesn't carry comics?"<br><br>"You should have picked out a book on woodworking." She turned around in her pew so she could face him, the magazine still opened up on her lap. "That birdhouse you made me for Christmas, I saw you working on it in your father's workshop. Saw the care you took when you stained it."<br><br>"I did a good job."<br><br>"No, you did a terrific job," she said, and smiled. That smile made men stop and take notice of her. That smile reassured him that everything was going to turn out all right.<br><br>"Where did you get that?"<br><br>"Get what?"<br><br>"That scarf."<br><br>"This thing? I've had this for a long time."<br><br>His mother's lies were as easy to spot as her bruises. She was careful never to wear the scarf around Lou, putting it on only after she left the house, taking it off and stuffing it in her jacket pocket before she got home, and Mike also knew she hid the scarf, along with the photo albums, in a box marked sewing in the basement. One early Saturday morning, after Lou had left for work, Mike had caught her in the basement, removing the scarf from the box -- the same hiding spot for her photo albums.<br><br>She caught the question in his eyes and said, "The scarf was a gift from my father. He gave it to me our last Christmas in Paris. I just don't want anything to happen to it."<br><br>"Paris. Oo la la."<br><br>Smiling, she placed the magazine on his lap and pointed to a color picture that showed the inside of an old church. The walls seemed a mile high, made of cracked white marble, the domed ceiling painted with a stunning portrait of Jesus Christ exposing his heart to the world.<br><br>"This is the Sacrï¿½-Coeur church," she said proudly. <i>"C'est l'endroit le plus beau du monde."</i><br><br>When he heard his mother speak in her native French, heard the way the words rolled off her tongue, it made her seem more like the exotic young woman he had discovered in the black-and-white pictures pasted in the photo album. Sometimes, when he was alone in the house, he would sit in the cellar and study the pictures of his grandparents, his mother's friends, her home -- everything she left behind in Paris to come here. The way these people dressed reminded him of royalty. At night, Mike would lie in bed and dream of an army of Parisians who would come to his house and rescue him and his mother.<br><br>"The pictures really don't do it justice," she said, and then leaned in closer. "The first time I stepped inside that church, I knew God was a real presence that could be felt and could fill you with love. But you have to believe, Michael. That's the key. Even when life is bad to you, you have to remember to keep your heart open to God's love."<br><br>"This picture has gargoyles."<br><br>"That's Notre-Dame. Amazing, isn't it?"<br><br>"Gargoyles on a church. That has to be the coolest church in the world."<br><br>"Michael, do you ever wonder what goes on outside of Belham?"<br><br>"Not really," he said, his eyes fastened to another picture of a gargoyle, this one with its fangs bared, ready to leap down from the sky and strike down mortal sinners who dared to enter.<br><br>"Are you curious?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>Mike shrugged, flipped a page. "Everything I know is here. The Hill and the Patriots and all my friends."<br><br>"You could make new friends."<br><br>"Not like Wild Bill."<br><br>"William's an original, I'll give you that."<br><br>"Dad said the problem with Paris is that it's full of French people."<br><br>"Your father's not a brave man."<br><br>Mike whipped his head up from the magazine. "But he fought in the Vietnam War," he said, not quite sure why he was defending his father. Mike didn't know what the Vietnam War was -- well, not exactly. He knew war involved guns and knifes and bombs and lots of blood and lots and lots of dead people. Mike had seen several old black-and-white war movies on TV.<br><br>"Holding a gun or hurting someone doesn't make you brave, Michael. Real bravery -- <i>true</i> bravery -- involves the spirit. Like having faith your life will turn out better when it looks like it won't. Having faith -- that's real bravery, Michael. Always have faith, no matter how bad it looks. Don't let your father or anyone else take that away from you, okay?"<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Promise?"<br><br>"I promise."<br><br>His mother reached into her jacket, came back with a black velvet box and placed it on top of the magazine.<br><br>"What's this?" he asked.<br><br>"A gift. Go ahead. Open it."<br><br>He did. Inside was a gold chain affixed to a circular gold medal the size of a quarter. Etched on the medal was a bald man cradling a baby. The man, Mike knew, was a saint. The halo was always a dead giveaway.<br><br>"That's St. Anthony," his mother said. "He's the patron saint of lost things." She took the chain from the box, put it around his neck and then clasped it, Mike feeling a shudder when he placed the cold medal under his sweater, against the warmth of his skin. "As long as you wear it," she said, "St. Anthony will keep you safe. I even had Father Jack bless it for you."<br><br>"Cool. Thank you."<br><br>The next day she was gone. Her car, an old Plymouth Valiant with rust pockets mended with duct tape, was parked in the driveway when he came home. Mike expected to see her in the kitchen, reading one of her paperback romances by the table near the window. The house was quiet, too quiet, he thought, and a sense of panic he couldn't quite identify brushed against the walls of his heart. He went upstairs to her bedroom, and when he turned on the light and saw the neatly made bed, he bolted back down into the kitchen, opened the door for the basement and descended the stairs, Mike remembering how lately his mother sat down here in one of the plastic patio chairs and lost herself in her photo albums. When he hit the bottom step, he saw the box marked sewing in the middle of the floor. He removed the box top, saw that the photo albums and the blue silk scarf she kept hidden in there were gone, and right then he knew, with a mean certainty, that his mother had packed up and left without him.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2004 by Chris Mooney</p><h2>Greek and Roman Artillery: Technical Treatises</h2><p>Five Greek and Latin treatises, with a facing English translation, which enable Marsden to trace mechanical progress in Greek and Roman artillery over five hundred years.

Empty Boxes?"<br><br>Back in 1978, Kip Tindell (Chairman &amp; CEO of The Container Store) and his partners had the vision that people were eager to find solutions to save both space and time - and they were definitely onto something. A new category of the retailing industry was born - storage and organization. Today, with stores nationwide and with more than 5,000 loyal employees, the company couldn't be stronger. Over the years, The Container Store has been lauded for its commitment to its employees and focus on its original concept and inventory mix as the formula for its success. But for Tindell, the goal never has been growth for growth's sake. Rather, it is to adhere to the company's values-based business philosophies, which center on an employee-first culture, superior customer service and strict merchandising. The Container Store has been named on <i>Fortune magazine's </i>"100 Best Companies To Work For" list for 15 consecutive years. Even better, The Container Store has millions of loyal customers.<br><br>In <i>Uncontainable</i>, Tindell reveals his approach for building a business where everyone associated with it thrives through embodying the tenets of Conscious Capitalism. Tindell's seven Foundation Principles are the roadmap that drives everyone at The Container Store to achieve the goals of the company. <i>Uncontainable </i>shows how other businesses can adapt this approach toward what Tindell calls the most profitable, sustainable and fun way of doing business. Tindell is that rare CEO who fully embraces the "Golden Rule" of business - where all stakeholders - employees, customers, vendors, shareholder, the community - are successful through a harmonic balance of win-wins.</p><p>Kip Tindell is currently Chairman &amp; CEO of The Container Store. He was presented with Ernst &amp; Young's prestigious Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1991 and is a recipient of the National Retail Federation's 1998 Innovator of the Year Award. In 2006, along with wife Sharon Tindell (Chief Merchandising Officer) and Garrett Boone (Chairman Emeritus), Tindell was inducted into the Retailing Hall of Fame and he is a 2009 Junior Achievement of Dallas Business Hall of Fame inductee. <br><br>Most recently Tindell received the National Retail Federation's 2010 Gold Medal Award, the most coveted award in retail, given to individuals who have served the industry with distinction and achieved a national reputation for excellence. He serves on the board of Whole Foods Market (WFMI), the executive board of the National Retail Federation as its Vice Chairman and is on the Board of the Baylor Healthcare Systems Foundation. He is a leader and passionately involved in Conscious Capitalism, Inc.To put it briefly,&nbsp;<i>Uncontainable&nbsp;is the best book about creating corporate culture since Danny Meyer's <i>Setting the Table</i></i><em> in 2006. In fact, along with Meyer, John Mackey, Tony Hsieh, Herb Kelleher, David Neeleman, and Howard Schulz, (and, as a philosophical precursor, Steve Jobs), Tindell is a member of the growing cadre of company leaders in the Conscious Capitalism movement. I highly recommend any business owner with an interest in efficacious corporate culture put <i>Uncontainable</i> on her reading list. - <b>Tim Askew, Inc.com </b> </em></p><h2>Strange Piece of Paradise</h2><p>In the summer of 1977, Terri Jentz and her Yale roommate, Shayna Weiss, make a cross-country bike trip. They pitch a tent in the desert of central Oregon. As they are sleeping, a man in a pickup truck deliberately runs over the tent. He then attacks them with an ax. The horrific crime is reported in newspapers across the country<i>. </i>No one is ever arrested. Both women survive, but Shayna suffers from amnesia, while Terri is left alone with memories of the attack. Their friendship is shattered.<br><br>Fifteen years later, Terri returns to the small town where she was nearly murdered, on the first of many visits she will make &#x201c;to solve the crime that would solve me.&#x201d; And she makes an extraordinary discovery: the violence of that night is as present for the community as it is for her. Slowly, her extensive interviews with the townspeople yield a terrifying revelation: many say they know who did it, and he is living freely in their midst. Terri then sets out to discover the truth about the crime and its aftermath, and to come to terms with the wounds that broke her life into a before and an after. Ultimately she finds herself face-to-face with the alleged axman.&nbsp;Powerful, eloquent, and paced like the most riveting of thrillers, <i>Strange Piece of Paradise </i>is the electrifying account of Terri&#x2019;s investigation into the mystery of her near murder.

I was scarcely twenty.<b></b><br>* * *<br>it was 1977, a drought year in the American West, the driest year in recorded history, although history in those parts went back only a hundred years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Back then, all of America was in a drought. The fever dream of the sixties had simmered down and the country had lost its way. The national mood was dispirited, in recovery from shocks and traumas, pinched by stagnation and inflation. Fatalism shadowed sunny American optimism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gas prices had never been higher. But I didn&#x2019;t care. I was riding a bike.<br>&nbsp;<br>America was hardly past its two hundredth birthday as I was nearing my twentieth. Its bicentennial year called for celebrations to restore a sense of the nation&#x2019;s magic and promise. Out of that came a bicycle trail, the BikeCentennial, forged from coast to coast through America&#x2019;s most spectacular countryside. My college roommate and I were riding the trail on our summer vacation. Encouraged by the 1970s culture to strive for self-discovery, we were hoping that the song of the open road would enlarge life&#x2019;s meaning.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the Cascades of the Northwest, drought conditions were melting the glaciers left from the last ice age. The mountain passes cleared unusually early in the summer of &#x2019;77 and allowed us to scale the highest pass. On the seventh day of our journey, we rode up through green rain forest. At the summit, a field of lava, night-black, surrounded us from every direction, as if a devastating fire had burned through only yesterday. Breathing in the air of the heights, we headed down. Trees abruptly appeared again. Only now they were reddish desert trees.<br>&nbsp;<br>We set up our tent along a river in a small park in a desert of juniper and sage, and bedded down for the night. It was Wednesday, June 22, the summer solstice. As the earth slowly turned in the dark, Americans in one time zone after the next settled in front of their TVs, safe in their living rooms. They watched the CBS Wednesday-night movie, the world television premiere of a dark and unsettling Western, one of those edgy films made in the seventies that reflected the mood of national cynicism. It was a film complete with psychopaths and moral degeneracy, a new American mythology that turned the romantic version of the Old West on its head.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sound of screeching tires woke me. It was near midnight, and we had just gone to sleep. A stranger deliberately drove over our tent, then attacked us both with an axe. I saw his torso. He was a meticulous cowboy who looked like he had stepped off a movie set.<br>&nbsp;<br>My great voyage across America ended abruptly there. And that was how I reached young adulthood, with a certain knowledge of life at its farthest edges.</p><h2>Benediction (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><b>A Shelf Awareness Best Book of the Year</b><br><br>From the beloved and best-selling author of <i>Plainsong </i>and <i>Eventide</i> comes a story of life and death, and the ties that bind, once again set out on the High Plains in Holt, Colorado.<br><br>When Dad Lewis is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he and his wife, Mary, must work together to make his final days as comfortable as possible. Their daughter, Lorraine, hastens back from Denver to help look after him; her devotion softens the bitter absence of their estranged son, Frank, but this cannot be willed away and remains a palpable presence for all three of them. Next door, a young girl named Alice moves in with her grandmother and contends with the painful memories that Dad's condition stirs up of her own mother's death. Meanwhile, the town&#x2019;s newly arrived preacher attempts to mend his strained relationships with his wife and teenaged son, a task that proves all the more challenging when he faces the disdain of his congregation after offering more than they are accustomed to getting on a Sunday morning. And throughout, an elderly widow and her middle-aged daughter do everything they can to ease the pain of their friends and neighbors. <br><br>Despite the travails that each of these families faces, together they form bonds strong enough to carry them through the most difficult of times.&nbsp; Bracing, sad and deeply illuminating, <i>Benediction </i>captures the fullness of life by representing every stage of it, including its extinction, as well as the hopes and dreams that sustain us along the way. Here Kent Haruf gives us his most indelible portrait yet of this small town and reveals, with grace and insight, the compassion, the suffering and, above all, the humanity of its inhabitants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2013</strong>: Kent Haruf writes about small towns and regular people, but don&#x2019;t underestimate his ambition. He is writing about <em>life</em>, and to do that he has returned again and again--first with <em>Plainsong</em>, later with <em>Eventide--</em>to the small town of Holt, located on the eastern plains of Colorado. In <em>Benediction</em>, Haruf introduces us to Dad Lewis, a 77-year-old hardware store owner who has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The experience of reading Haruf is a slow burn, but as we meet the people who gather around Dad Lewis in his final days we begin to see that this is a book about community, about the things that bind us, as well as the secrets we keep to ourselves. Haruf writes with a tense, quiet realism that elevates life and death, granting both a dignity that touches on poetry. --Chris Schluep <p></p>Kent Haruf&#x2019;s honors include a Whiting Foundation Writers&#x2019; Award, the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Award, the Wallace Stegner Award, and a special citation from the PEN/Hemingway Foundation; he has also been a finalist for the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the New Yorker Book Award.&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives with his wife, Cathy, in their native Colorado.</p><h2>Tap, Tap</h2><p>Peter Tummelier uses his newfound vampire powers to embark on a bloodthirsty quest for vengeance on the enemies of his childhood friend, Roscoe Bird, and to seduce Roscoe to the vampire life.

These simple homes speak to us of history and values, promising both comfort and protection. <br> The "country look" remains the single most popular American style. Despite social and economic changes and the whims of fashion, it continues to shape our design and decorating tastes. Now in these lavishly illustrated pages, <i>American Farmhouses</i> offers a rich and inspiring survey of country architecture and design, from painted furniture to porches, stenciling to saltbox houses. <br> Part of the appeal of country homes lies in their hand-hewn individualism and heritage of Old World charm. Many familiar design elements derived from distinct traditions brought by the early settlers, then adapted to local conditions and materials. Even in the early twentieth century, most country houses were still designed and constructed by local craftsmen, resulting in an immensely rich variety still visible in farms large and small across the country. <br> Today, the interior of a country home can be a meticulous restoration in a traditional style or a flea-market mix of furnishings and collectibles. The nearly twenty profiles of country homes in <i>American Farmhouses,</i> ranging from a rustic German-style house in Texas to a classic Greek Revival in upstate New York to a contemporary reinterpretation in Connecticut, are full of stimulating and original ideas. <br> To help readers bring the "country look" home, whether in a city apartment or a rural getaway, <i>American Farmhouses</i> also includes a detailed sourcebook of manufacturers, craftsmen, and architectural antiques dealers nationwide. Here is everything from cast-iron firebacks to milk paint to farmhouse tables, from suppliers who continue to keep the spirit of the farmhouse vital and alive today.</p><p>Leah Rosch, formerly the executive editor of American Homestyle &amp; Gardening magazine, has written for The New York Times as well as This Old House and Metropolitan Home magazines. Keith Scott Morton, the principal photographer for Country Living magazine, has been a leading photographer of country homes and interiors for fifteen years."Few history books capture the story of America's past as vividly as the farmhouses that fill our countryside," says the author in this excellent primer to America's "most prevalent form of architecture." Rosch, a former editor of <i>American Homestyle and Gardening </i>magazine, introduces the evolution of farmhouses, from the log cabin and saltbox to ornate Greek revival and Queen Anne, illustrated throughout in a fine mix of color photographs. She also notes the major architectural and interior features of farmhouse design, explaining the often pragmatic history that spurred their invention--how rooms were used, why materials were chosen. Closing chapters spotlight stunning homes across the country that show the evolution of the farmhouse form, including small cottages and sprawling homes that ingeniously connect barns and outbuildings to the main structure. The interiors represent both preservationist and eclectic aesthetics; several homes successfully blend traditional and contemporary sensibilities. Extensive lists of craftsmen and suppliers of period furnishings and materials conclude the book. More than just a glossy coffee-table book of cozy nostalgia. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Rozan's memorable Lydia Chin/Bill Smith series of mysteries, and the tough and taciturn private eye really comes into his own. Smith has cloistered himself in his remote cabin in upstate New York, where he escapes from his private devils by fishing, hunting, and practicing Mozart and Bach on his piano, when he is sucked into two local crime cases.<p> The first involves Tony Antonelli, the brother of a young man whom Smith once helped out of trouble. Tony finds the body of a murdered local hoodlum in the cellar of his roadhouse. His brother Jimmy suspiciously goes missing and becomes the leading suspect. The second case involves a reclusive older woman (who turns out to be a world-famous painter). She asks Bill to track down some of her early works, which had been stolen from her studio. There's also a very nasty sheriff who hates Smith, a moderately tolerant state trooper who grudgingly helps, a corrupt executive of a babyfood company and his sad, dangerous teenage daughter, plus a crew of smalltime crooks who give the lie to the myth of rural safety. Lydia doesn't get called in from the Big Apple until quite late, and when she arrives she attracts stares in the local 7-Eleven "as though she were a black-petalled orchid that had sprung up in the daisy patch. Back in the car, Lydia grinned, said, 'Not many Asians up here, huh?' 'Especially in black leather,'" Bill answers." </p><p> The plot might have one or two tangles too many for its own good, but as usual Rozan proves herself to be one of the best descriptive writers in the genre, bringing to indelible life everything from a modern painter's latest work, to a depressed countryside where the last stone quarry is about to close down and grind away a few more dreams. </p><p>Other books in this award-winning series: <i>A Bitter Feast</i>, <i>Concourse</i>, <i>Mandarin Plaid</i>, and <i>No Colder Place</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>"<i>Stone Quarry</i> is S.J.

A simple enough observation, but one that becomes subtle and nuanced in this landmark book which attempts to define, for the first time, what Nordic building really is.<br> <br> Norberg-Schulz begins by contrasting the natural world of the North with that of the Mediterranean, the Nordic unendingness against the sun-saturated and homogeneous South. Using themes such as "natural," "domestic," "universal," and "foreign," he finds the architecture of both regions sensibly related to their environments; but whereas the South lends itself to abstraction, the North is marked by variation, openness, and dynamism&#x2014;by low light, forests, and space.<br> <br> Exploring the ways built experience "takes place," Norberg-Schulz charts the distinctive character of land and climate that distinguishes Denmark's, Sweden's, Finland's, and Norway's architectural traditions from each other and from those to the South. While each of these countries might be said to share regional traits, Norberg-Schulz identifies differences (the cultivated and closely detailed landscape and architecture of Denmark, the dramatic, structured forms of Norway) that allow him to account for the way individual Nordic architectures evolved.</p><p>Architecture is a manifestation of the environment in which it is placed, observes distinguished architect and theoretician Christian Norberg-Schulz.

The town of Foxbury (inhabited by foxes) enjoys its own unique style of law enforcement. Every morning, the local constables primp and prepare for inspection. One morning a month, the town burglars carry out a mock burglary, which gives the constables much-needed practice in criminal catching. Usually, civility reigns throughout. This time, however, the Foreman Burglar decides that his group should commit a real theft. Of course, neither party has any experience with true crime, and the result is a wild, slapstick romp that will delight youngsters. As in his earlier books, Oakley employs a winning combination of sometimes exaggerated, sometimes understated tongue-in-cheek humor. Much of the amusement springs from his typically lively, detailed line-and-wash illustrations. The visual story enhances and expands the zany narrative. This book is sure to please Oakley's loyal fans as well as add to his following.<br><i>Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, WI</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Once a month in the village of Foxbury, the Town Burglars stage a robbery to provide the local constabulary with a little policing practice. However, when the Foreman Burglar decides to speed off with the glittery proceeds from a jewelry heist, the foxy police force is obliged to follow in hot pursuit. Oakley's (the Church Mice books) unlikely text bubbles with wit ("He knew they were too honest to be trusted") as it moves briskly through plot twists and good-natured surprises. Highly detailed illustrations extend the humor with small touches (foxes dressed down in flowery underwear, a country cottage sporting a cable dish) as the FPD shows little guile and less cunning. Especially appealing are scenes from the car chase and a set of inserts depicting the police force, truncheons at the ready, as they tiptoe through the darkness of an old castle. Much fun, and plenty of child-appeal.

Even after Dane Fundan completes his massive project, the last free space-colonization vessel, and offers passage to those who want to escape the domination of Earth's World Government, his unholy alliance with wealthy, corrupt Arabs threatens to turn the craft into an interstellar slave-ship. In the absence of a plot beyond the chronicling of the journey itself, the book moves along without compelling force. Each new scene of cruelty on Earth, on the starship, or on the New World is a self-contained drama in which the band of expatriates keeps learning the same lesson: treachery will be found wherever conscious life appears. Despite the 25th-century setting, Rowley's message is a time-worn platitude: people must purge the dross from their own souls or risk incurring their own destruction. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thief in the Brown Van (Tom &amp; Ricky Mystery, No 2)</h2><p>Thief in the Brown Van (Tom &amp; Ricky Mystery, No 2)</p><p></p><h2>A History of the World in 21 Women: A Personal Selection</h2><p><b>From the bestselling author of <i>A History of Britain in 21 Women</i></b><br> <br>The history of the world is the history of great women.<br> <br>Marie Curie discovered radium and revolutionised medical science.

Aspasia Gray&#x2019;s beauty is as haunting as her connection to Tobias. Her long-deceased fiancï¿½ was a friend of his--in addition to being an eccentric assassin.

The cobra diadem that graced her long, elaborately braided black wig gleamed in the light of a nearby wall sconce. Wry amusement lit her dark eyes. &#x201c;It has been a long time, has it not? May I come in?&#x201d;<br><br>It had, in fact, been three years since he had last seen Aspasia Gray, but she had changed very little. She was still a stunningly beautiful woman with a classical profile that was well-suited to her guise as the queen of Egypt. He knew that her real hair was a deep, rich brown. Her tall, elegantly proportioned figure was displayed to advantage in a pale green gown trimmed with gold embroidery.<br><br>The last thing he wanted to do tonight was renew old acquaintances, Tobias March thought. But the sight of Aspasia Gray had definitely shattered the mood. Memories from that very dark time three years ago crashed over him with the force of storm-driven waves.<br><br>He collected his wits with an effort and quickly surveyed the darkened hallway behind Aspasia. There was no sign of Lavinia. Maybe, if he acted swiftly, he would be able to rid himself of his unwelcome visitor before his evening was entirely ruined.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;d better come in.&#x201d; Reluctantly, he stepped back.<br><br>&#x201c;You have not changed, sir,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Still as gracious as ever, I see.&#x201d;<br><br>She entered the firelit room with a soft rustle of silken skirts and a whisper of exotic perfume. He closed the door and turned to face her.<br><br>He had not noticed any Cleopatras at the costume ball earlier in the evening, but that was not surprising. Beaumont Castle was a huge, sprawling monstrosity of a house, and tonight it was crammed with people. He had been interested in only one particular guest.<br><br>The invitation to the house party had come through the auspices of Lord Vale. Tobias&#x2019;s first, automatic inclination had been to decline the offer. He had little interest in such affairs. House parties, in particular, struck him as tedious at best, albeit his experience of them was limited.<br><br>But then Vale had reminded him of the one singular attraction of a properly organized country-house party.<br><br>Yes, there are the lengthy, boring breakfasts and the frivolous conversations and the silly games, but bear in mind this vastly important, highly relevant point: you and Mrs. Lake will each be provided with a private bedchamber. Furthermore, no one will pay the least attention to which of those bedchambers you decide to occupy at night. Indeed, the true objective of a well-planned house party is to provide ample opportunities of that sort.<br><br>The reminder of the true nature of a large house party had struck Tobias with the force of a lightning bolt. When Vale, who had no intention of attending the Beaumont affair, graciously offered the use of one of his private carriages for the journey, Tobias had felt himself inspired.<br><br>He had been surprised, not to say greatly relieved, when Lavinia agreed to the plan with very little fuss. He suspected that her enthusiasm was generated in large part because she viewed the house party as an excellent opportunity to fish for new business. But he refused to allow that fact to depress his spirits. For the first time in their acquaintance, they would enjoy the luxury of being able to spend the better portion of not one but two entire nights in the cozy warmth and privacy of a real bed.<br><br>The prospect had been dazzling. For once there would be no need to sneak about in remote sections of the park or make do with the desk in Lavinia&#x2019;s little study. For three glorious days he would not be obliged to rely on the benevolent graces of Lavinia&#x2019;s housekeeper, who could sometimes be persuaded to take herself off to shop for currants when he came to call.<br><br>He certainly savored the all-too-brief encounters alone with Lavinia in town, but those occasions&#x2014;stimulating though they were&#x2014;tended to be rushed and occasionally nerve-racking. The weather had a nasty habit of delivering rain on afternoons when he chose the park for a tryst, and one never knew when Lavinia&#x2019;s niece, Emeline, might select an inopportune moment to return home.<br><br>There was also the unpredictable nature of the business in which he and Lavinia were engaged. When one offered one&#x2019;s services to persons who wished to commission private inquiries and investigations, one never knew when a client might knock on the door.<br><br>He looked at Aspasia. &#x201c;What the devil are you doing here? I thought you were in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am well aware that you have a tendency to be blunt to the point of rudeness on occasion, Tobias. But surely I deserve a warmer welcome from you. It is not as though I am only a casual acquaintance, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>She was right, he thought. The two of them were forever linked by the events of the past and by a dead man named Zachary Elland.<br><br>&#x201c;My apologies,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;but the truth is, you have caught me very much by surprise. I did not see you this afternoon when the other guests descended on the castle, nor did I notice you at the costume ball tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I arrived quite late, after the evening festivities had commenced. I saw you at the ball, but you were preoccupied with your little redheaded friend.&#x201d; Aspasia stripped off her gloves with languid grace and held her hands out to the fire. &#x201c;Who on earth is she, Tobias? I would not have said that she was your type.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her name is Mrs. Lake.&#x201d; He did not bother to conceal the edge to his words.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, I see.&#x201d; She looked down into the flames. &#x201c;You are lovers.&#x201d; It was a statement, not a question.<br><br>&#x201c;We are also business partners,&#x201d; he said evenly. &#x201c;On occasion.&#x201d;<br><br>Aspasia glanced at him, fine brows lifted in a faintly quizzical expression. &#x201c;I do not understand. Do you refer to some financial dealings in which the two of you are engaged?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a manner of speaking. Mrs. Lake and I both make our livings in the same fashion. She takes commissions for private inquiries, just as I do. We investigate certain cases together.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled fleetingly. &#x201c;I suppose the private-inquiry business is a step up from being a spy, but surely it is not nearly as respectable as your previous career as a man of business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I find it suits my temperament.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will not ask how your partner made her living before she went into this odd profession.&#x201d;<br><br>Enough was enough, he thought. There were limits to one&#x2019;s obligations to old acquaintances. &#x201c;Aspasia, tell me why you are here. I have plans for the remainder of the night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Plans that no doubt include Mrs. Lake.&#x201d; Aspasia sounded genuinely apologetic. &#x201c;I truly am sorry, Tobias. Please believe me when I tell you that I would not have come to your bedchamber at this hour had it not been extremely urgent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can this matter wait until morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid not.&#x201d; She turned away from the fire and walked slowly toward him.<br><br>Aspasia was a woman of the world. He knew that she was well-schooled in the fine social art of concealing her private sentiments and feelings. But now he glimpsed a disturbing shift in the shadows beneath her cool veneer. He had seen that same emotion often enough in others to recognize it instantly. Aspasia Gray was afraid.<br><br>&#x201c;What is wrong?&#x201d; he asked, somewhat more gently this time.<br><br>She sighed. &#x201c;I did not come here to spend a few days rusticating in the country.

This morning I went straight to your address in Slate Street but you had already departed. Your man informed me that you had left for Beaumont Castle and would be gone for several days.

She delights in entertaining. It has been her passion for years, and Lord Beaumont is only too happy to indulge her.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone in Society certainly did not include Lavinia or himself, he reflected. They managed to hang around on the fringes of the polite world thanks to connections with some wealthy, powerful former clients such as Vale and Mrs. Dove, but that association did not automatically qualify them to be placed on any hostess&#x2019;s regular guest list.<br><br>Aspasia&#x2019;s pedigree, on the other hand, was impeccable.

Reissue.</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#39;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.Sister Octavia Lock swept through the swing doors of Casualty on a wave of vague ill&#x2013;humour; she had over&#x2013;slept and as a consequence had had no breakfast save a cup of tea, drunk far too hot and as much toast as she could cram into her mouth with one bite, and over and above that, it was a glorious September morning with enough of autumn in the air to make her wish that she was at home and not in a London hospital, hemmed in by narrow streets and rows of shabby little houses. And now, to make matters worse, she could see at a glance that Casualty, even at eight o'clock in the morning, was already filling itself up fast. Her senior, Sister Moody, who tended to take her time in coming on duty after breakfast, would as a consequence doubtless live up to her name. Octavia's eye lighted upon a small forlorn boy sitting by himself and, her ill&#x2013;humour forgotten, she swept him along with her on the way to the office, asking his name and what was the matter as they went. 'Stanley,' he told her tearfully, and his mum had sent him along because he'd burnt his arm the day before.<p>Octavia sighed, popped him into a cubicle and began to take off his too&#x2013;small jacket. It amazed her that although patients crowded into Casualty, a vast number of them took their time about it. And if I'd been this mum I'd have brought Stanley here pretty smartly, she reflected, gently</p><p>laying bare a sizeable burn wrapped in a handkerchief. The blisters weren't broken, and that was something to be thankful for; she slid the handkerchief away and replaced it with gauze, said: 'OK Stanley, the doctor will come and make that much more comfortable for you,' warned a student nurse about him, and went into the office. One of the night Sisters was already there ready to leave and Octavia listened carefully to the night report, happily short and fairly uneventful, before she remarked gloomily: 'You may have had a good night, Joan, but I've a nasty feeling that we're in for a perfectly foul day&#x2014;are you on tonight?'</p><p>Her companion grinned smugly. 'Nights off&#x2014;you'll have Snoopy Kate on...'</p><p>'Oh, lord, and I'm on till nine o'clock. Sister Moody wants the evening; I'll have to have a split.' She paused and smiled suddenly: 'It's my weekend off, though.'</p><p>They parted then, Joan to breakfast and bed, Octavia into Casualty to cast an eye over the patients already being treated and then those who were waiting. There was nothing urgent; cuts and bruises, septic fingers, a fractured collarbone which a nurse had already put into a collar and cuff, a number of small children with earache, sore throats and the like and the usual sprinkling of elderly men and women for morning dressings and stitches to be removed. She had just finished her round when Sister Moody arrived, nodded briefly and retired to the office, to stay there for a good deal of the day, doing the paper work and only coming out when an urgent case came in; not that she did much to help then; explaining comfortably to Octavia that at her age it would be ridiculous to expect her to take too active a part in the work while Octavia was perfectly capable of coping.</p><p>Octavia started her daily round of the cubicles and dressing rooms and small theatre, checking this and that</p><p>with care but not wasting time. Nurses would be going to their coffee break in an hour and the quicker the light cases were dealt with the better. She could hear the steady hum of voices through the theatre door and all the sounds that went with it; the clatter of bowls, the faint click of instruments tossed into receivers, the telephone&#x2014;she would have to go and give a hand. All the same, she paused by a window and gazed out into the street outside, full of traffic and people hurrying to work, a tall girl with a splendid figure and a lovely face crowned by rich brown hair, drawn back neatly under her cap, although a number of small curls had escaped to frame her face. Her eyes were hazel, large and heavily fringed and topped by black brows and her mouth curved gently, and as though these weren't enough, she had a happy nature, marred only occasionally by a fiery temper. She turned away from the window presently and went back into Casualty, rolling up her sleeves as she went.</p><p>The day went as most days went; a steady trickle of minor casualties, interrupted frequently by the more severely injured as well as a small girl with a perforated appendix and an elderly man who had been found alone, half starved and dirty in a pokey little room in one of the rows of small houses close to the hospital. He had opened weary eyes as Octavia bent over him and told her fretfully to leave him alone, 'Because what's the use of getting me on my feet again?' he wanted to know. 'I've nowhere to go and no one to bother about me.'</p><p>Octavia, taking his blood pressure, gave him a motherly smile. 'You just wait,' she admonished him kindly, 'there's no reason why you shouldn't be fit enough to get a job. You just need fattening up, you know. How old are you?'</p><p>'Sixty&#x2014;who'd want the likes of me, I'd like to know?'</p><p>'Let's worry about that when the time comes&#x2014;first we'll get you better.' She turned at the tap on her shoulder. 'Here's the doctor to have a look at you.'</p><p>He had pneumonia, not badly&#x2014;nothing that a few days in hospital wouldn't put right. Octavia arranged for him to be admitted to the men's medical ward and when he asked her if she would visit him, promised cheerfully that she would.</p><p>'Now that's a great shame,' she declared to John Waring, the Casualty Officer. 'A nice man like that thrown out of work because the family went to Switzerland&#x2014;the least they could have done would have been to try and get him fixed up with someone else, or even taken him with them&#x2014;I mean, after fifteen years working for them,' she paused. 'I'm not sure what a handyman does...'</p><p>'Makes himself handy,' and then more seriously: 'I agree with you, Octavia, and he hasn't much chance of getting any work&#x2014;I suppose he would be unskilled labour, and he's getting on.' John finished the notes he was writing up and looked up at her. 'Are you off this evening? How about a film?'</p><p>She shook her head regretfully. 'I'm off...' she glanced at the clock, 'now, then I'm on until nine and I'll be fit for nothing by then.'</p><p>'Tomorrow, then?'</p><p>'Lovely&#x2014;but aren't you on call?'</p><p>He grinned at her. 'I'll get someone to stand in for me.'</p><p>A nice boy, she reflected as she went through the hospital on her way to lunch and off duty. She had been out with him several times, indeed she had been out with most of the housemen in St Maud's at one time or another, for she was popular with everyone and as pretty as a picture to boot, but although a surprisingly large percentage of them had wanted to marry her, she had remained heartwhole.</p><p>By the time she had reached the canteen and joined her friends at table, she had forgotten all about John Waring.</p><p>She returned to Casualty just before six o'clock, to find it almost as full as when she had left it and Sister Moody waiting impatiently for her.</p><p>'There's a query appendix in the end bay,' she was told swiftly, 'a scalp wound next to it, and then a Colles fracture...' she was ticking the cases off on her fingers, 'a crushed thumb, septic foot...the rest haven't been seen yet. Nurse Barnes is taking their names now&#x2014;John Waring will be down presently. We had a couple of RTAs in&#x2014; they're warded&#x2014;oh, and a BID I've had no time to make up the book.' She was already half way through the door as she spoke and now, with a briefly muttered goodnight, she was gone.</p><p>There were two student nurses on duty as well as Mrs Taylor, a reliable nursing aide who had been in Casualty for so long that no one could remember when she had first come; she was elderly now and not able to lift or do any heavy work, but she was invaluable because she knew where everything was and fetched it at the drop of a hat. Octavia sent her to help the senior of the student nurses to marshall the remainder of the patients ready for John Waring and took the other nurse with her to deal with the appendix first and then, seeing that the man was resting comfortably, to get the scalp wound cleaned up, something Sister Moody might have done and hadn't.</p><p>It was almost nine o'clock, after a steady stream of patients had been dealt with, that the street entrance was flung open and a tall man with wide shoulders and a giant's stride came in. He was carrying a little old lady in his arms and rather to Octavia's surprise, walked across the department to deposit her carefully on a couch in one of the bays. Only then did he turn to address her.</p><p>'Mugged,' his voice was deep and unhurried. 'You're in charge? Well, get the Casualty Officer here at once, will you?'</p><p>Octavia, bending over the small figure, paused for a moment to look up at the man. She said evenly: 'Thanks for bringing her in, you can safely leave the rest to us now.'</p><p>He was a handsome man, with fair hair liberally sprinkled with grey, looking down his high&#x2013;bridged nose with cold blue eyes. He looked, she realised suddenly, as though he didn't like her. With something of an effort she clung to her professional calm and then found it in shreds when he went on: 'I shall remain until she has received adequate treatment.'</p><p>Octavia let out an indignant snort and managed to hold her tongue. She could deal with the tiresome man presently, but now she bent to her patient, taking off the battered felt hat to search for head wounds, taking her pulse moving her arms gently and when the old lady opened her eyes, asked quietly: 'Can you tell me where it hurts, my dear? You're quite safe now, in hospital, but I don't want to move y...</p></p><h2>Virgil Finlay&#39;s Strange Science</h2><p>This book contains over 140 black and white illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Wallace Stevens: The Early Years, 1879-1923</h2><p>Uses Stevens&#39; journals and letters, and the reminiscences of friends, family members and colleagues to recount the second half of the American poet&#39;s life</p><p>Stevens claimed that he never read other poets, yet, as this massive biography reveals, he held imaginary dialogues with his favorite "man-poets," Hardy and Plato among them. A successful insurance executive and man of letters, he had a precarious sense of self and attempted in his verse to define an ideal self abstracted from his humdrum, bourgeois world. Combining psychobiography and criticism, this first half of a two-volume work argues that Stevens made his wife into a mother figure because he was unable to integrate the feminine into his psyche. The poet comes across as demanding, priggish, miserly, aloof, but the real subject here is the process of his mind, how his arresting images crystallized, and how they amplified or concealed his inner self. Richardson's dense, wordy study rewards the patient reader. No other book gets into the workings of Stevens's imagination so deeply. The author, a professor at City University of New York, has uncovered fascinating material on Stevens's meeting with Dada artist Duchamp and his borrowings from commedia dell'arte. (September <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The time has long been ripe for a complete biography of Stevens. The author of this attempt says that the poet "took on for me the roles of father, teacher, lover. . . . I have questioned whether I could or can properly call my consciousness my own." She goes on to hypothesize at great length minute, indeed ineffable, details of Stevens's mental life, while failing to put in order basic facts about her subject. Her discussion of the poetry, marred by digressions into history, religion, and art criticism as well as by turgid prose, relies heavily on non sequitur and flat assertion. The most suggestive and cogent exploration of connections among Stevens's life, thought, and poetry remains Milton Bates's Wallace Stevens ( LJ 8/85); a suitable biography remains to be written.Frank J.

This large-format volume showcases Spirin's illustrations for six of Andersen's most famous fairy tales: "The Ugly Duckling," "Thumbelina," "The Steadfast Tin Soldier," "The Nightingale," "The Princess and the Pea," and "The Little Mermaid." The foreword includes comments on Andersen's life and significance and states that this collection of stories is "drawn from some of the earliest translations of his work." The typeface is rather small, but the book's overall design is handsome. Spirin's artwork, watercolor with colored pencil, creates an atmosphere of grandeur, mystery, and sophisticated beauty. Varying from powerful, double-page spreads to small, decorative cameos, the pictures look formally composed and perhaps from another age. Although some are reminiscent of Flemish paintings and others of Chinese screen paintings, each illustration suits the setting and mood of its particular tale, all the while maintaining a unity of style throughout the volume. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

A pap smear is considered abnormal when abnormal cervical cells are found. Cervical dysplasia is a term used to describe abnormal cervical cells taken during the pap smear. Cervical dysplasia is usually graded according to its severity, which can range from mild inflammation to precancerous changes to localized cancer.<br><br> If an abnormality is detected early, the doctor can prescribe effective treatment before the problem becomes more serious. Cervical cancer (page 000) is a common, sometimes fatal disease. It is now known that human papilloma virus (HPV), also the cause of genital warts (page 000), is the major cause of cervical dysplasia.<br><br> What are the symptoms of an abnormal pap smear?<br><br> There are no symptoms of cervical dysplasia until the disease has progressed into advanced cancer. Therefore, it is crucial that sexually active women, or women over age 20, have yearly Pap smears until the age of 65. Women who experience bleeding between menstrual periods, bleeding after intercourse, abnormal vaginal discharge, abdominal pain or swelling, urinary symptoms, or pelvic pain should be evaluated by a healthcare provider, even if it is not the regular time for a Pap test.<br><br> Medical treatments<br><br> If the Pap smear is normal, no further tests are necessary until the next yearly Pap test. If the cells collected on the Pap smear are abnormal, a repeat test and a pelvic exam where the doctor looks at the cervix with a special magnifying lens (colposcope) may be recommended. Sometimes a small piece of tissue is removed from the cervix (biopsy) and examined under a microscope to see if there are any precancerous changes or cancer present. If these additional tests find an early stage of cervical cancer, it is either treated by removing the affected portion of the cervix (cone biopsy) or by removing the entire cervix and uterus (abdominal hysterectomy).<br><br> Checklist for Abnormal Pap Smear<br><br> Nutritional<br><br> RatingSupplementsHerbs<br><br> HHHFolic acid (page 000)<br><br> (for women using oral<br><br> contraceptives)<br><br> HHIGreen tea extracts (page 000) (poly E or (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate)<br><br> HIISelenium (page 000)Echinacea (page<br><br> Vitamin A (page 000)000), Goldenseal<br><br> Vitamin E (page 000)(page 000), Marsh-<br><br> mallow (page 000), Myrrh (page 000), Usnea (page 000), Yarrow (page 000) (suppository; in various combinations)<br><br> Dietary changes that may be helpful<br><br> Most dietary studies have found that women consuming high amounts of nutrients from fruits and vegetables have less risk of cervical dysplasia. Protective effects may be especially strong from diets high in dark yellow/orange vegetables (carrots, winter squash, etc.) and tomatoes.<br><br> Lifestyle changes that may be helpful<br><br> Cigarette smoking increases the risk of cervical dysplasia, and increases the likelihood that mild forms of dysplasia will progress to more severe forms. Quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke are essential for this and many other health reasons.<br><br> Certain sexual behaviors are consistently associated with cervical dysplasia, such as becoming sexually active at an early age and having multiple sexual partners. Avoiding these behaviors may reduce the risk of cervical dysplasia. For those who are sexually active, using barrier methods of contraception, such as a condom or diaphragm, is associated with reduced risk of cervical dysplasia.<br><br> Nutritional supplements that may be helpful<br><br> Large amounts of folic acid (page 000)&#x2014;10 mg per day&#x2014;have been shown to improve the abnormal Pap smears of women who are taking birth control pills. Folic acid does not improve the Pap smears of women who are not taking oral contraceptives. High blood levels of folate (the food form of folic acid) have been linked to protection against the development of cervical dysplasia but these folate levels may only be a marker for eating more fruit and vegetables.<br><br> Women with cervical dysplasia may have lower blood levels of beta-carotene (page 000) and vitamin E (page 000) compared to healthy women. Low levels of selenium (page 000) and low dietary intake of vitamin C (page 000) have also been observed in women with cervical dysplasia. Women with a low intake of vitamin A (page 000) have an increased risk of cervical dysplasia. However, there is little research on the use of vitamin A as a treatment for cervical dysplasia.<br><br> In a double-blind trial, when women with cervical abnormalities were given either 500 mg of vitamin C or 50,000 IU beta-carotene per day for two years, no significant evidence of improvement was seen in either group, and those assigned to both supplements experienced a statistically insignificant worsening of their condition. Given that the apparent association between these supplements and deterioration of the condition of the cervix appears to have been due to chance, there is currently no sound evidence supporting the use of vitamin C or beta-carotene supplements for women with cervical dysplasia.<br><br> Are there any side effects or interactions?<br><br> Refer to the individual supplement for information about any side effects or interactions.<br><br> Herbs that may be helpful<br><br> In a preliminary study, women with cervical dysplasia were randomly assigned to receive either (1) 200 mg per day of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (a flavonoid found in green tea [page 000]), (2) 200 mg per day of poly E (a green tea extract), or (3) no treatment (control group) for 8 to 12 weeks. Approximately two-thirds of the women receiving (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or poly E had an improvement in their Pap smear, compared with only 10% of the women in the control group.<br><br> Several other herbs have been used as part of an approach for women with mild cervical dysplasia, including myrrh (page 000), echinacea (page 000), usnea (page 000), goldenseal (page 000), marshmallow (page 000), and yarrow (page 000). These herbs are used for their antiviral actions as well as to stimulate tissue healing; they are generally administered in a suppository preparation. No clinical trials have proven their effectiveness in treating cervical dysplasia. A doctor should be consulted to discuss the use and availability of these herbs.<br><br> Are there any side effects or interactions?<br><br> Refer to the individual herb for information about any side effects or interactions.<br> Acne Rosacea<br><br> Acne rosacea, now more accurately know just as rosacea, is a chronic skin condition of the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. It consists of flushing, which turns into red coloration from the dilation of the capillaries and can lead to pustules that resemble acne.<br><br> Rosacea occurs mostly in middle-aged adults with fair skin. The cause of rosacea is unknown, but there is likely a genetic component. Severe, untreated rosacea can be disfiguring to the face.<br><br> What are the symptoms of acne rosacea?<br><br> The skin of the center of the face&#x2014;typically on or surrounding the nose&#x2014;is red and swollen, with acne-like blemishes. As the condition progresses, parts of the eye can become inflamed and the nose may enlarge.<br><br> Checklist for Acne Rosacea<br><br> Nutritional<br><br> RatingSupplementsHerbs<br><br> HIIBetaine hydrochloride Burdock (page 000)<br><br> (page 000)<br><br> Digestive enzymes<br><br> (page 000)<br><br> Vitamin B-complex<br><br> (page 000)<br><br> Medical treatments<br><br> Prescription medications used to treat rosacea include topical and oral antibiotics. The main topical drug, metronidazole (Metrogel), is thought to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. The vitamin A-related medication tretinoin (Retin A), which is used for acne vulgaris, may also be prescribed. The most commonly used oral antibiotic is tetracycline (Sumycin).<br><br> Dietary changes that may be helpful<br><br> Alcohol may increase the reddening of the skin affected by rosacea, but alcohol is not the cause of this disease. Spicy foods and hot drinks have been reported anecdotally by rosacea sufferers to cause flare-ups, but no controlled research has evaluated these claims. One small, preliminary report suggested that fasting followed by a vegan diet (allowing no animal flesh foods, dairy products, or eggs) had only small and inconsistent effects on rosacea.<br><br> Lifestyle changes that may be helpful<br><br> Sun exposure, stress, excessive exercise, and extreme temperatures (hot or cold) of weather or bathing water may trigger flare-ups of rosacea, so avoiding these conditions is recommended.<br><br> Nutritional supplements that may be helpful<br><br> Azelaic acid is found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley and is used topically in a 20% strength cream. Controlled clinical trials have found this cream effective for mild to moderate acne, including rosacea. Azelaic acid cream is available by prescription only and should be used only under the supervision of the prescribing physician.<br><br> Preliminary reports in the 1940s claimed that rosacea improved with oral supplements or injections of B vitamins (page 000) On the other hand, one report exists of rosacea-like symptoms in a patient taking 100 mg per day of vitamin B6 (page 000) and 100 mcg per day of vitamin B12 (page 000); these symptoms subsided when the supplements were discontinued. More research is needed to evaluate the potential benefits or hazards of B vitamins for rosacea.<br><br> Some people with rosacea have been reported to produce inadequate ...&#x201c;<i>The Natural Pharmacy</i> will facilitate the acceptance of these beneficial natural therapies and give readers a useful road map as they join us on &#x2018;the road less traveled.&#x2019; &#x201d; &#x2014;Julian Whitaker, M.D., editor of <i>Health &amp; Healing</i> newsletter<br><br>&#x201c;From the foremost experts on herbs, homeopathy, and nutrition, this reference is an excellent sourcebook for help with the most common health conditions.&#x201d; &#x2014;James A.

During his fifty-year career he designed hundreds of buildings, and his distinctive architectural idiom left its imprint on the terrain of a vast empire extending from the Danube to the Tigris.</p><p>Sinan&#x2019;s mosques are considered among his best work, and with their light-filled centralized domes, remain a testament to his inventive spirit and passion for experimentation. In this major study of Sinan&#x2019;s extraordinary buildings, Gï¿½lru Necipoglu argues that Sinan&#x2019;s rich variety of mosque designs sprang from a process of negotiation between the architect and his patrons, rather than from unrestrained formal experimentation. Using primary source material, Necipoglu describes how Sinan created a layered system of mosque types, reflecting social status and territorial rank.</p><p>&#x201c;Brushing aside skewed orientalist and nationalist readings which have colored many previous studies of his work, the author, using original documentation, provides the most detailed written study ever, of not only Sinan&#x2019;s architecture, but also, arguably, of Ottoman culture, politics and society in the classical age &nbsp;. . .

As part of the choir of their school they travel by coach to participate in an inter-school singing competition. Warner provides every nuance of their characters in a sustained tour de force. It is just as though one were eavesdropping. This is the most profound of Warner s books. His sense of place and atmosphere remains extraordinarily intense. Guardian. Compassionate and riotously funny. It is a long time since I read a novel which had me rocking with laughter. The Times. Wonderful... humane, unique, a pageturner with a neat series of bombshells at the end . Daily Telegraph. Warner s third novel is as wild as his first... fantastically original... anyone who writes like this earns the right to be read. Mail on Sunday.</p><p>If there's any justice, Alan Warner's third novel, <i>The Sopranos</i>, will lead to a sudden fad for artificially shortened kilt skirts, bright shoelaces, and flaming sambuca shots. As it is, we might have to settle for the sopranos themselves, six memorably vile-mouthed Catholic schoolgirls sent from their drab port town to "the big, big city" for the Scottish national choir finals. There Warner follows them as they shop, smoke, eat Big Macs, consume staggering amounts of alcohol, and pay no attention whatsoever to the competition. Winning, after all, would defeat their central goal: returning in time for the slow dances at the Mantrap and the promise of submariners on leave. In the end, it turns out that the nuclear submarine has stopped in their harbor only to unload a dead sailor, and the girls must console themselves with alcohol, sex, a veritable inferno of fireworks, and even one heartbreakingly courageous kiss. <p> By turns bawdy and tender, funny and sad, <i>The Sopranos</i> faces adolescence head-on, without sentiment or false hope. Youth, for these girls, is precious precisely because they have so little to look forward to. When their friend becomes pregnant, she's already "devoured the few opportunities for the wee bit sparkle that was ever going to come her way." When the nuns' parrot--who likes to spout Spanish obscenities during Mass--escapes from the school, his bright colors are "like a happiness that wasn't allowed below such skies, against these curt roof angles of slate and granite." Theirs is a grim, circumscribed world, but the sopranos shine like tropical birds against the background of gray. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Alan Warner, who was born in Scotland, is the author of the novels <b>Morvern Callar</b>, which won the Somerset Maugham Award, and <b>These Demented Lands</b>, which won an Encore Award.

As romance hangs in the air the novel splinters into three different directions with three outcomes, each following the couple over 60 years. * DAILY EXPRESS * The story of Eva and Jim twists and turns over many decades in this thought-provoking love story. Great read. * PRIMA * written with intelligence and warmth * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT * A hugely engrossing and, ultimately, deeply moving book about connections, possibilities, regret and the complicated nature of love. * SUNDAY BUSINESS POST * In Laura Barnett&#39;s first novel, a good idea is cleverly executed . . . The Versions of Us is a confident debut. * THE INDEPENDENT * Clever but not showy, romantic but not schmaltzy, it&#39;s clear that the buzz around this book is justified. * DAILY MIRROR * Comparisons have been made with David Nicholls&#39; One Day and yes, it can be compared favourably with his masterpiece. This is a work of great mastery and deserves to be read and re-read for its own merits. * MATURE TIMES * In pieces having just finished Laura Barnett&#39;s The Versions of Us. Brilliant. * @btwhizz * Each version had its own moments that made me laugh and cry and I did find myself thinking about what my own different versions would be like. * thepagesbetween.com * Worth every tear rolling down my cheeks. It&#39;s a 2015 must-read! * strupag.com * glorious... a book that I think will do incredibly well come its release * A CASE FOR BOOKS * I recommend this book without reservation... This is a wonderful, exceptional book by Laura Barnett. I loved it. -- Moira Please * THE PERFECT WRITING RETREAT * It&#39;s hard to believe this is Laura Barnett&#39;s debut novel. It&#39;s so sophisticated and well put-together - I&#39;m completely in awe of how Barnett managed to write not just one story, but three, and make them all work perfectly together. * GIRL! REPORTER * It&#39;s annoying when a book won&#39;t let you give it up. You put it to one side and think &#34;maybe I will read that later&#34; because you have more important things to do. And there it is the next day, in your hands, wide open, pulling you back in, just not letting you go... As a first novel this is quite an accomplishment. * NEWBOOKSMAG * We follow (Eva and Jim) as their lives spin out in three different ways and so, inevitably, Sliding Doors comparisons kick in. But this is its own book; deep, sensitive and without a hint of commercial compromise.. Just lovely. * SAINSBURY&#39;S MAGAZINE * All the highs and lows of love are portrayed in this thought-provoking and moving read. -- Cathy Rentzenbrink * PRIMA * a fascinating debut novel that could well be this year&#39;s One Day. * BELLA * One to watch: we meet two characters, then time splits and follows three different versions of their lives. Each strand is distinct - and equally captivating. * GOOD HOUSEKEEPING * A clever, romantic debut.. Barnett tells three outcomes of the same affair, a simple, effective metaphor for the paths love itself can take you on, before winding up smartly in the present. * GRAZIA * One Day meets Sliding Doors * ELLE * Everyone&#39;s talking about The Versions of Us by Laura Barnett. Eva and Jim&#39;s first meeting has three possible outcomes.

Barnett suspends our disbelief like a conjuror -- Elizabeth Fremantle * SUNDAY EXPRESS * skilfully done * MAIL ON SUNDAY * both brilliant and astonishingly good * Elizabeth Buchan * I absolutely loved [The Versions of Us]. It&#39;s so elegantly and beautifully written... I was equally enthralled by each of the three versions...a really wonderful book. -- Esther Freud Truly enthralling... I simply adored this wonderful novel * Jessie Burton - author of The Miniaturist * an amazing piece of British literature - this book should definitely be on your reading list this summer if you enjoy contemporary romance and books that really make you think * BUZZFEED * We reckon that you&#39;ll see a few other people by the pool with their heads in this book as it&#39;s a classic summer read. One day meets Mad Men in this tale of the different ways a couple&#39;s relationship could have played out from the late 1950s to the present. * METRO * An affecting and thought-provoking work, The Versions of Us will keep you gripped until the tear-jerking conclusion. * DAILY EXPRESS * Maeve Binchy&#39;s death left a gap in the market for stories simply told with no literary affectation. Barnett&#39;s promising first novel reads like early Binchy.. the tantalising &#39;what if?&#39; theme keeps all three stories going at a cracking pace. * DAILY MAIL * Like Kate Atkinson&#39;s Life After Life or the film Sliding Doors, The Versions of Us, a fine debut by Laura Barnett, offers multiple &#34;what ifs&#34;... involving and poignant. * SUNDAY TIMES * The Versions of Us is well written, deftly crafted and constantly surprising, in the way that chaotic real life is surprising; through the technical exercise might sound a tad mechanical, Laura Barnett uses it with verve to tell an utterly convincing love story about two people destined to be together somehow, no matter what. -- Kate Saunders * THE TIMES * Barnett renders an irresistible concept in sweet, cool prose - a bit like a choose-your-own adventure book in which you don&#39;t have to choose. -- Hepzibah Anderson * THE OBSERVER * Its very scope is a joy, the technical achievement seamlessly done, and the ending - all the endings - suitably affecting -- Jenny Colgan * THE GUARDIAN * a triumphant debut.. a thoughtful, measured book about the interplay of chance and destiny in our lives. -- Elena Seymenliyska * SUNDAY TELEGRAPH * Summer Reading recommendation: I am 20 pages in and already hooked on Laura Barnett&#39;s counterfactual THE VERSIONS OF US, which is a kind of literary Sliding Doors * THE OBSERVER * Summer Reading recommendation: the beautiful love child of David Nicholl&#39;s One Day and Kate Atkinson&#39;s Life After Life * THE TIMES * Summer Reading choice: an intriguing debut * SUNDAY TIMES *</p><h2>Life Before Man ; Cat&#39;s Eye</h2><p>An omnibus edition of this author&#39;s work, which contains two of her novels; LIFE BEFORE MAN (1979) which looks at the relationship between a man and two women; and CAT&#39;S EYE (1989) which chronicles the life of one woman through four decades.</p><p></p><h2>Surviving Auschwitz: Children of Shoah</h2><p><p>CHILDREN OF THE SHOAH tells the story of three young girls who survived Adolph Hitler's most notorious death camp and a young Polish Jew who defied Hitler by masquerading as a Catholic fighter in the Polish Resistance. During World War II, Hitler murdered about one and a half million men, women and children at Auschwitz - the Nazi's largest extermination complex. Most of the victims were Jews. As Soviet forces advanced on Auschwitz in the winter of l945, the SS began evacuating the camp, force-marching 60,000 prisoners to Germany. About a fourth died from starvation and exposure or were shot by the SS for falling behind. In January, the Soviet army entered Auschwitz and found 7,000 prisoners alive. Among them were three young children from Tomaszow Mazowiecki, a town in central Poland. Tova Friedman, 6, Rachel Hyams, 7, and Frieda Tenenbaum, l0, had not only survived the Jewish ghetto in their town but two slave labor camps. They even survived the so called "children's camp" at Auschwitz, which in reality was a holding area for the gas chambers. CHILDREN OF THE SHOAH is a haunting first person memoir of these three girls, their accounts combining the immediacy of the child's experience with the sophistication of adult hindsight. These intensely moving stories are a remarkable gift of insight into the Holocaust years and its implications for all of us. The dramatic and moving photographs throughout the book add to the powerful and lasting emotional feeling that the readers will take with them.

Javier Falcï¿½n has been through therapy and is in the process of breaking free of the psychological damage sustained during his last major investigation. Called to the scene of a suspicious suicide in a wealthy neighborhood on the outskirts of Seville, he begins to investigate a case with no solid evidence when suddenly, in quick succession, two more suicides occur-one of them a fellow police officer in the sex crimes unit. Left to discover what made life so unbearable for these victims, Falcï¿½n's task is to find the connection among the suicides. Or were they, in fact, murdered?<br></p><p>"Murder is the greatest aberration of human nature, it brings out some ingenious subterfuges," remarks Inspector <i>Jefe</i> Javier Falcï¿½n, as he ponders a series of ambiguously motivated and ostensibly unconnected suicides in <i>The Vanished Hands</i>, British author Robert Wilson's sequel to his haunting 2003 novel, <i>The Blind Man of Seville</i>.<p> It's the summer of 2002, more than a year after the shattering events recounted in <i>Blind Man</i>, and Falcï¿½n, the chief homicide cop in Seville, Spain, has finally regained his confidence and powers of concentration. Still, he cannot fathom why Rafael Vega, a construction company honcho (and recreational butcher), should have smothered his younger, unstable wife in bed, then chugged a fatal draught of drain cleaner. Is there any connection between this tragedy and the disappearance of the Vegas's Ukranian gardener, or money laundering by the local Russian mafia? Can Rafael Vega's demise be related to his distrust of the U.S. government or to a note found in his hand, with its seeming allusion to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks? As Falcï¿½n questions the Vegas's suburban neighbors, he discovers one couple linked to the slaying of an Iranian carpet-dealer in New York, and another nearby resident, renowned actor Pablo Ortega, whose grown son is in prison for kidnapping and abusing an 8-year-old boy. Yet these scandals aren't obviously helpful to Falcï¿½n in solving the Vega case. Nor do they explain why those first deaths are soon followed by Ortega's drowning in a cesspool, the suicidal leap of an aging child-crimes investigator, and Russian mafia threats against Falcï¿½n.</p><p> Wilson doesn&#x2019;t exploit Seville's exotic setting so well here as he did in <i>Blind Man</i>, and it can be challenging to follow this sequel's political backstory. However, the author more than makes up for these weaknesses with the depth of his psychological explorations, the ways in which he taunts his police with justice slightly beyond their reach, and a patient storytelling pace that enhances investigative revelations. Falcï¿½n remains a potent and pivotal figure, his traumas in the last book being replaced in these pages by personal dramas (three different women tug at the inspector <i>jefe</i>'s heart, feeding his hope without depleting his loneliness). Founded in mendacity, fraught with betrayals, <i>The Vanished Hands</i> maintains a firm grip on the reader from its start. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2004, 0-15-100841-8<br></p><h2>Under the Skin</h2><p>Isserley picks up hitchhikers with big muscles. She, herself, is tiny-like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. She has a remarkable face and wears the thickest corrective lenses anyone has ever seen. Her posture is suggestive of some spinal problem. Her breasts are perfect; perhaps implants. She is strangely erotic yet somehow grotesque, vulnerable yet threatening. Her hitchhikers are a mixed bunch of men-trailer trash and travelling postgrads, thugs and philosophers. But Isserley is only interested in whether they have families and whether they have muscles. Then, it's only a question of how long she can endure her pain-physical and spiritual-and their conversation. Michel Faber's work has been described as a combination of Roald Dahl and Franz Kafka, as Somerset Maugham shacking up with Ian McEwan. At once humane and horrifying, Under the Skin takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory-our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion. A grotesque and comical allegory announcing the arrival of an exciting talent, rich and assured.<br></p><p>In the opening pages of <i>Under the Skin</i>, a lone female is scouting the Scottish Highlands in search of well-proportioned men: "Isserley always drove straight past a hitch-hiker when she first saw him, to give herself time to size him up. She was looking for big muscles: a hunk on legs. Puny, scrawny specimens were no use to her." At this point, the reader might be forgiven for anticipating some run-of-the-mill psychosexual drama. But commonplace expectation is no help when it comes to Michel Faber's strange and unsettling first novel; small details, then major clues, suggest that something deeply bizarre is afoot. What are the reasons for Isserley's extensive surgical scarring, her thick glasses, her excruciating backache? Who are the solitary few who work on the farm where her cottage is located? And why are they all nervous about the arrival of someone called Amlis Vess? <p> The ensuing narrative is of such cumulative, compelling strangeness that it almost defies description. The one thing that can be said with certainty is that <i>Under the Skin</i> is unlike anything else you have ever read. Faber's control of his medium is nearly flawless. Applying the rules of psychological realism to a fictional world that is both terrifying and unearthly, he nonetheless compels the reader's absolute identification with Isserley. Not even the author's fine short-story collection, <i>Some Rain Must Fall</i>, prepared us for such mastery. <i>Under the Skin</i> is ultimately a reviewer's nightmare and a reader's dream: a book so distinctive, so elegantly written, and so original that one can only urge everybody in earshot to experience it, and soon. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>Now a Major Motion Picture "Alternately gorgeous and terrifying, lyrical and brutal, "Under the Skin "compels and teases . . . Satisfying and successful." "Newsday"In this haunting, entrancing novel, Michel Faber introduces us to Isserley, a female driver who cruises the Scottish Highlands picking up hitchhikers. Scarred and awkward, yet strangely erotic and threatening, she listens to her hitchhikers as they open up to her, revealing clues about who might miss them if they should disappear. A grotesque and comical allegory, "Under the Skin" takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion to present a surreal representation of contemporary society run amok."A wonderful book painful, lyrical, frightening, brilliant . . .

No artist ever captured Harlem's dangerous highs and bluesy lows like this Master of the Performing Curve. Hirschfeld began his artistic Harlem odyssey six decades ago, charting that legendary New York neighborhood's special rhythms and moods in splashy feverish hues. <i>Hirschfeld's Harlem</i> opens onto a special portfolio of these full-color works, a pictorial essay of the Swing Era. Wynton Marsalis, Quincy Jones, Lena Horne and Harry Belafonte, among a dozen other Harlem artists and critics, supply accompanying commentary, reminiscences and analysis &#x2013; each voice focusing on one portrait.<br><br>Then it's back to Hirschfeld in his signature black and white takes on forty Harlem artists and public figures: Gregory Hines, Duke Ellington, James Earl Jones, Ethel Waters and dozens more &#x2013; all have been caught in the creative act by one of our greatest artists. Each drawing is accompanied by a thumbnail narrative by Hirschfeld about the most famous inhabitants and transients of these fabled streets. <i>Hirschfeld's Harlem</i> opens a picture window into nearly a century of Black American artistry and life.</p><p>"I have been so continuously enchanted with the Harlem I had grown up near and visited my whole life. . .Harlem people just keep on rising above whatever met them at eye level; regardless of the rugged terrain or the economic weather, Harlem residents had their own means of levitation. They performed an art form beyond the Arts, beyond the stage, beyond the Cotton Club. Very real people meeting reality head on and then stubbornly transcending it. Some commentators have made much of the fact that these aren&#x2019;t Hirschfeld's typical performers. Well, they&#x2019;re not on the stretch of Broadway I had covered before or since. But these Harlemites are performers all right. They are in rehearsal for the performance of their lives. It&#x2019;s that grand profound ritual I hope to have captured here." <p>-Al Hirschfeld, January 2003, from his preface, Drawing on Harlem</p>The late great Al Hirschfeld was designated a &#x201c;Living Legend&#x201d; by the Library of Congress. The United States Post Office has issued 15 stamps with Hirschfeld drawings. He is the recipient of two Tony Awards for Lifetime Achievement. His work has been prominently featured in <i>The New York Times</i> for nearly 75 years. He has been represented in exhibitions at major art museums and institutions, including the Smithsonian's National Portrait gallery, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Whitney Museum, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Museum of the City of New York. His <i>Hirschfeld On Line</i> was published by Applause Books.</p><h2>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h2><p>For over 100 years this story has enchanted both the young and the young at heart. Come now and share their adventure as Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion travel down the Yellow Brick Road to meet the Wizard of Oz.</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>Urban Design the Architecture of Towns and Cities</h2><p>hardcover , architecture</p><p></p><h2>Maranatha!

In less than a half-hour, it was all over. The Divisional Commander wrote of the Newfoundland effort: &#x201c;It was a magnificent display of trained and disciplined valour, and its assault failed of success because dead men can advance no further.&#x201d;<br><br>Well might the Germans refer to the Battle of the Somme as <i>das Blutbad </i>&#x2013; the bloodbath. From 1 July to 15 November 1916, a period of just 138 days, more than 310,000 soldiers from four great armies &#x2013; the British, Canadian, French, and German &#x2013; were killed. The German death toll on the Somme was larger than that of all the Allied forces combined. A total of 164,055 Germans died on the narrow battlefield while the total number of Allied dead was 146,404. The Somme cost Canada 24,029 casualties.<br><br>The heroism of the Dominion troops moved British prime minister David Lloyd George to write: &#x201c;The Canadians played a part of such distinction that thenceforward they were marked as storm troops. . . .<br><br>Whenever the Germans found the Canadian Corps coming into the line, they prepared for the worst.&#x201d; This book is an illustration of what Winston Churchill called the &#x201c;vile and utter folly and barbarism&#x201d; of war. It also shows war&#x2019;s incredible patriotism and heroism.</p><p><b>Martin Gilbert</b>, the author of more than seventy books, is Winston Churchill&#x2019;s official biographer and a leading historian of the modern world. In 1995 he was knighted &#x201c;for services to British history and international relations,&#x201d; and in 1999 he was awarded a Doctorate of Literature by the University of Oxford for the totality of his published work. As a British schoolboy he was sent to Canada to live out the years of World War II in safety. He now divides his time between London, Ontario, and London, England.There was one Dominion force fighting on the Somme on July 1, the 1st Battalion, Newfoundland Regiment, which formed part of the second wave of attackers against the village of Beaumont Hamel. Because their own front-line trenches were clogged with bodies and debris from the first assault, and because the advance of the Essex Regiment on its right flank was delayed because the trenches in front of them were likewise clogged with the dead of the first wave of attackers, the Newfoundlanders had to cross 750 yards of exposed front without flank support. Many were killed as they clambered out of their trenches. Few reached even to the line of their own barbed wire, which lay 250 yards beyond their starting point. <br><br>Those Newfoundlanders who did reach their own wire - four well-laid belts of wire in all - had to follow the zigzag lanes between pre-cut, highlighted gaps, which had been exactly pinpointed by the German machine-gunners. Those who did manage to emerge through these gaps in the wire discovered that at least 500 yards of open ground lay between them and the first line of the German defences. That open ground lay on a forward slope, exposed to German fire from their positions on the facing hill. Near a particular tree half way down the slope, known to the Newfoundlanders as &#x2018;The Danger Tree&#x2019;, German shellfire was especially accurate and fatal. Today the remains of that tree serve as a stark memorial to those who were killed around it.<br><br>Some of the Newfoundlanders were able to get close enough to the German line to hurl their hand-held bombs into the enemy trenches, but most had been struck down long before that point. The official Newfoundland historian writes: &#x2018;Where two men had been advancing side by side, suddenly there was only one - and a few paces farther on he too would pitch forward on his face. A young subaltern looks around him in vain for men to lead. Defiantly he brandishes his field telephone at the German trenches; then putting down his head to charges to his death. The leading man of a pair carrying a ten-foot bridge is hit, and as he falls he brings down with him bridge and partner. Without hesitation the latter gets up, hoists the bridge on his head, and plods grimly forward until machine-gun bullets cut him down.&#x2019;<br><br>Those few Newfoundlanders who reached the German wire were shot down as they tried to cut their way through it with their wire cutters. By ten in the morning every officer who had gone into battle less than an hour and a half earlier was either killed or wounded. <br><br> A British soldier, Private Byrne, who was in the text wave of attackers, recalled his first sight of his predecessors: &#x2018;Ahead of me were two Newfoundland blokes &#x2014; one on the left-hand side was lying well up to the German wire and the other, about twenty-five years to his right, was spread-eagled over the German wire itself. They were quite dead, there was no doubt.&#x2019;<br><br>Of the 810 Newfoundlanders in action that morning, 310 were killed and more than 350 wounded. Only sixty-eight escaped serious injury. Captain Eric Ayre was one of four members of his family to be killed on July 1, including his only brother, Captain Bernard Ayre, who was serving with the Norfolk Regiment near Maricourt, at the other end of the Fourth Army front. Eric Ayre, aged twenty-seven, is buried in the Ancre Cemetery. His brother, aged twenty-four, is buried at Carnoy.<br><br>During the afternoon, on the Beaumont Hamel sector as elsewhere, wounded men trying to crawl back across No Man&#x2019;s Land to their own lines did not know that their tin triangles, meant to be identification for their own artillery during the advance, were flashing continually as they moved painfully across the open ground, signalling their position to the German snipers and machine gunners. The Regiment&#x2019;s twenty stretcher bearers worked all day under fire to bring wounded men back. When they found Lieutenant Bert Dicks propped up in a trench and prepared to put him on a stretcher he insisted: &#x2018;Take those who are in greater need, I can stick it out&#x2019;, and he did. Many of the Newfoundlanders who reached the safety of their own lines had only one question: &#x2018;Is the Colonel satisfied? Is the Colonel pleased?&#x2019;<br><br>When the battle was over the commanding officer of the 29th Division, General de Lisle, informed the Prime Minister of Newfoundland: &#x2018;It was a magnificent display of trained and disciplined valour, and its assault only failed of success because dead men can advance no further.&#x2019;<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides With Samuel Johnson, L.L.D.

Perhaps most impressive is the collection of novelties and knickknacks, including &#34;gag&#34; cocktail napkins, old bowling trophies, a light-up bow tie, and the requisite bongo drums.

Reprint.</p><p>James B. Patterson (born March 22, 1947) is an award-winning American author. Formerly an advertising executive for J. W. Thompson in the early 1990s, Patterson came up with the slogan &#34;Toys R Us Kid&#34;. Shortly after his success with Along Came A Spider he retired from the firm and devoted his time to writing. The novels featuring his character, Alex Cross, a black forensic psychologist formerly of the Washington, D.C. Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, now working as a private psychologist and government consultant, are the most popular books among Patterson readers. James Patterson has been criticized by Stephen King, who called Patterson&#39;s books &#34;dopey thrillers&#34;.[citation needed] Patterson shrugged off the comments, stating that he wants to be the &#34;thrillingest thriller writer of all time&#34;.[citation needed] James Patterson has also been put as one of Forbes magazine&#39;s top 100 celebrities.The title refers to a national state of economic disaster after terrorists bomb strategic Wall Street sites. It also alludes to the sale of billions of dollars' worth of stolen securities, a scheme intended to cripple the United States financially. These events are made credible by the masterful storytelling of Edgar Award winner Patterson. Short, tight chapters that shift rapidly among the fascinating cast of characters successfully raise doubts about who's good and who's not as the suspense mounts. Several action scenes are rather violent and a bit gory, but they pass quickly in this fast-paced page turner. There are also some genuinely touching moments. Highly recommended.

From the crowded dance tent at Pulaski Polka Days to an off-the-grid Mexican polka dance in small-town Wisconsin, "Polka Heartland" explores the people, places, and history behind the Midwest's favorite music.</p><p>From polka's surprising origin story as a cutting-edge European fad to an exploration of the modern-day polka scene, author Rick March and photographer Dick Blau take readers on a joyful romp through this beloved, unique, and richly storied genre. "Polka Heartland" describes the artists, venues, instruments, and music-makers who have been pivotal to polka's popularity across the Midwest and offers six full-color photo galleries to immerse readers in today's vibrant polka scene.</p></p><p><p>Author and folklorist <b>Rick March</b> has participated in the Midwest polka scene for more than three decades. He is a preeminent scholar of Midwest music history and culture, a longtime radio host on Wisconsin Public Radio, a producer of polka CDs for Smithsonian Folkways, and a polka musician in his own right. March is retired from the Wisconsin Arts Board.</p><p><b>Dick Blau</b> has a BA from Harvard and a PhD from Yale. A self-taught photographer, filmmaker, and performer, he co-founded the highly regarded Department of Film at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Blau calls his work an ethnography of the feelings. His subjects range from highly personal dramas to huge communal events. Blau has co-authored three books on the culture of celebration: <i>Polka Happiness</i>, <i>Skyros Carnival,</i> and <i>Bright Balkan Morning</i>. Blau lives with writer Jane Gallop in downtown Milwaukee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><i>Polka Heartland</i>, a rollickingly entertaining and educational book that traces its origins as a cutting-edge European fad to its current status as a festival favorite in cities, towns and villages across Wisconsin. <b>(Michael Popke, The Isthmus, November 2015)</b><br><br> In the introduction to Polka Heartland, March (state folklorist for Wisconsin, 1983-2009) writes that he and photographer Dick Blau "aim for in-depth, visually oriented views into the active polka scenes of [their] region" and that it is a project they do not "take lightly." Blau did the photography for Charles Keil and Angeliki Keil's Polka Happiness (CH, Mar'93, 30-3740), and he and March have long been immersed in the Midwestern polka scene. As a result, the present title is a well-plotted survey of what polka is, where it originated, and how it made its way to the Midwest. What is more, they provide engaging synopses of the various styles of polka in the Midwest. Between chapters are "polka interludes"&#x2014;brief passages that address such things as the difference between a concertina and an accordion, and why beer and polka go well together. Blau&#x2019;s charming color photos are an excellent complement to March&#x2019;s eloquent prose.

Just back from WWII, Jack Haldean agrees to meet his cousin Isabelle and her fiancï¿½, Arthur, for tea at the Savoy. But when the trio is introduced to the famous Arabian explorer Durant Craig, Jack&#x2019;s reaction is both bizarre and unexpected. Putting it down to the after-effects of war, Isabelle and Arthur persuade Jack to accompany them to a house party in rural Sussex. But at the party, the trio witnesses a gruesome car fire. Assuming it&#x2019;s a tragic accident, Jack soon realizes it&#x2019;s murder, and when Durant Craig turns out to have been present, Jack suspects the explorer&#x2019;s involvement. What he can&#x2019;t know is that the murder will force him to revisit one of the most traumatic episodes of his life, compel him to return to the Arabian desert, and force him to confront an old and deadly nemesis.

Her pictures have appeared in Time, Newsweek, Men&#39;s Journal, Life, and The New York Times, as well as numerous major European publications. Her photographs of the Maasai have been awarded prizes for portrait and reportage by the Society of Publication Designers.An American war photographer based in Nairobi for most of the '90s, Gilbert abandoned the carnage of Rwanda, Somalia and the Sudan in 1998 and set out "to get back to the richness of the land and its heritage." For her, that meant the 5,000-square-mile tribal reserve of the Maasai in Kenya and Tanzania via a four-year sojourn sponsored by Kodak and Corbis, the photo archive owned by Bill Gates. Famous fighters who grace countless "postcards, T-shirts, safari advertisements, and hotel logos" in Africa, the Maasai and their way of life are simultaneously overexposed and subject to "[e]ducation and the demands of a modern economy" that are driving the remaining 400,000 or so members apart. In the text, Gilbert yearns after "something purely African," and her treatment of the Maasai is a mixed bag of nostalgia, understanding, incomprehension, glorification and attempts at cultural relativism that are sorely strained by the "female circumcision" (ritual removal of the clitoris) that is compulsory for Maasai women, as well as other practices. But if one takes the text as secondary, many of the 120 b&amp;w photos and 40 historical illustrations emerge powerfully. Beyond the expected elders sitting proudly for portraits, warriors roaming the plains with spears raised and lion-hunt carnage, Gilbert, with serious reservations, manages to get inside the hut where a woman is "circumcised" (she documents the circumcision of a man as well) and reveals a few emotional chinks in the Maasai armor. While she does not succeed in making their way of life fully comprehensible to outsiders, she does set it in dramatic relief.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The King&#39;s English: A Guide to Modern Usage</h2><p>Written by one of the most important and controversial icons in British post-war fiction, this study represents the late author&#39;s last, and often humorous word, on the state of the English language as we close the twentieth century. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Kingsley Amis's <i>The King's English</i> is as witty and biting as his novels. Modestly presented as a volume "in which some modern linguistic problems are discussed and perhaps settled," Amis's usage guide is a worthy companion to his revered <i>Fowler's</i>. <i>The King's English</i> is distinctly British, but never mind: it is sensational. And unlike many of his countrymen, Amis is decidedly pro-American, even admitting a "bias towards American modes of expression as likely to seem the livelier and ... smarter alternative." In a world populated by usage mavens too willing to waffle, Amis is refreshingly unequivocal. On the expression <i>meaningful dialogue</i>? It "looks and sounds unbearably pompous. Nevertheless one would not wish to be deprived of a phrase that so unerringly points out its user as a humourless ninny." To cross one's 7's, he says, "is either gross affectation or, these days, straightforward ignorance." And the frequently misused word <i>viable</i>, he claims, "should be dropped altogether ... simply because it has taken the fancy of every trendy little twit on the look-out for a posh word for feasible, practicable." Forget Amis's protestations of being unfit for the position of language arbiter; after all, as he says, "the defence of the language is too large a matter to be left to the properly qualified." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mr. Midshipman Hornblower</h2><p>&#34;Oxford Bookworms&#34; offer students at all levels the opportunity to extend their reading and appreciation of English.

In this book, as in the earlier title, Monty provides a transportation service by carrying children (frog, duck, and rabbit) across the river on his back. The adult members of the animal community, in their wisdom, decide that there must be a more efficient means of transportation . To readers' delight, they fail and eventually come to the conclusion that there is a need for Monty. Stevenson presents a simple moral in an effective and humorous fashion. The underlying theme that grown-ups are not always right is subtly presented in a simple style. The text has a definite beginning, middle, and end that is hand printed in cartoon captions; illustrations are in watercolor and black line that sustain the drollness found in the text (note Monty's subdued smile). This is a remarkably effective picture book with definite child appeal that will be treasured, remembered, and enjoyed by young children. Bessie Egan, Winnipeg Public Library, Manitoba, Canada<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.That immensely likable alligator from Monty is back, still reliably ferrying the children to school. One day, however, the grown-ups decide that "the Monty system" is too slow; surely they can come up with a faster one. As the weeks go by, each method they propose, from skyride to stilts, fails with more hilarity than the one before. Finally, a grinning Monty appears, and the children climb aboard what they knew all along was the best way to go to school"the Monty way." As always, Stevenson's messagehere, about the perils of innovation for its own sakeis delivered with an ample dose of humor. The pacing is sure and swift, and the dramatic failures of the grown-ups' deliciously pompous inventions are hilarious.

Our old postwar alliances are crumbling. Everywhere you look there's an omen, a joke whose punchline is the end of the world. How do we live in the shadow of such a grim future? What does the world hold for our children? What might it be like to live through the worst? And what is anybody <i>doing</i> about it? <br><br>Dublin-based writer Mark O'Connell ("wryly humorous, cogently insightful" --NPR) is possessed by these questions. In <i>Notes from an Apocalypse</i>, he crosses the globe in pursuit of answers. He tours survival bunkers in South Dakota. He ventures to New Zealand, a favored retreat of billionaires banking on civilization's collapse. And he bears witness to those places the future has already visited--real-life portraits of the end of the world as we know it. In doing so, he offers a unique window into our apocalyptic imagination. <br><br>Part tour, part pilgrimage, <i>Notes from an Apocalypse</i> is an affecting and hopeful meditation on our alarming present moment. With insight, humanity, and wit, O'Connell leaves you to wonder: What if the end of the world <i>isn't</i> the end of the world?</p><p>MARK O'CONNELL is the author of <i>To Be a Machine</i>, which was awarded the 2019 Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize, and was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction.

He sees the angler's environment all around him-in New York's Grand Central Station, in the cement-lined pond of a city park, in a shimmering bonefish flat in the Flordia keys, in the trout streams of the Rocky Mountains. He marvels at the fishing in the turbid Ohio River by downtown Cincinatti, where a good bait for catfsh is half a White Castle french fry. The incidentals of the angling experience, the who and the where of it, interest him as much as what he catches and how. The essays (including the famous profile of master angler Jim Deren, late proprietor of New York's tackle store, the Angler's Roost) contain sharply focused observations of the American outdoors, a place filled with human alterations and detritus that somehow remains defiantly unruined. Frazier's simple love of the sport lifts him to straight -ahead angling description that are among the best contemporary writing on the subject. <i>The Fish's Eye</i> brings together twenty years of heartfelt, funny, and vivid essays on a timeless pursuit where so many mysteries, both human and natural, coincide. <br></p><p><b>Ian Frazier</b> lives in Montclair, New Jersey. He is a frequent contributor to the <i>New Yorker</i>, among other publications. His previous books include <i>Great Plains</i>, <i>On the Rez</i>, <i>Family</i>, and <i>Coyote V. Acme</i>. <br>All 17 of the angling pieces Frazier (On the Rez) has written over the last 20 years have now been preserved in one volume. Attentive readers of the New Yorker over the last two decades will have caught most of these pieces before, but anglers and essay fans (not to mention Frazier devotees) should be glad to revisit gems like "An Angler at Heart," his 1981 profile of a Manhattan tackle dealer. Frazier's sharp eye and self-implicating wit is at work in these charming but unsentimental pieces, whether he's describing his penchant for mayflies in "It's Hard to Eat Just One," a family fishing trip in which his kids prefer a drainage ditch to the trout stream in "A Lovely Sort of Lower Purpose," or a Central Park pond where the fishermen are as likely to catch empty potato chip bags as catfish in "Anglers." Many of these essays are, in fact, about fishing in the city, and Frazier often wrings more suspense and meaning from a muddy stream that runs "From Wilderness to Wal-Mart" than some outdoor adventure writers get from an expedition through Nepal. His paeans to the angling experience set the standard in this subgenre, yet will amuse many who've never set foot in a tackle shop. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Key West</h2><p>A photographic survey of Key West, profusely illustrated in color.</p><p></p><h2>Mel Ramos Albums</h2><p>Mel Ramos (born 1935) combines Pop Art with the laid-back lifestyle of California.

He was the first and only child of a skilled carpenter and his good wife, both of whom, I am sorry to say, died when the Black Death came to their village at the foot of Mount Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1343. Little Klaus, barely out of babyhood then, had no other family, and so he was adopted by the Worshipful Guild of Foresters, Carpenters, and Woodworkers. It was very unusual for the Guild to adopt a child, but Klaus's father had been a much-loved member, and so they did it. Of course, the Masters of the Guild were extremely preoccupied with their work of making plows and houses and clock gears--many, many things were made of wood in those days--and they really did not have the time to rear Klaus. So, mostly, they didn't. They gave him plenty of food, which he liked very much. They gave him old carpenter's tools instead of toys. And they gave him genial, distracted pats on the head whenever he came within range--benign neglect. It was a very satisfactory arrangement.<br><br>It is not surprising that Klaus became a very fine worker of wood. He had the best carvers and joiners and carpenters to watch and learn from, even though they did not actually notice they were teaching him. What was surprising--even alarming to some in the Guild--was that by the age of seventeen he had quietly surpassed them all. The piece he made to prove that he deserved to be awarded the title Master--his master-piece--was an exceptionally lovely chair by any standard. It was expertly joined, intricately and richly carved, and inlaid with all fourteen hardwoods that grew on Mount Feldberg. It was immediately adopted by the Guild as the new Governor's chair. Klaus was given his Master Woodworker's badge--a gold pine tree--toasted with ale, and slapped on the back for congratulations.<br><br>"We must have raised you well, Klaus," the Masters said, "though we confess we didn't notice."<br><br>"Yes, you must have!" said Klaus and laughed. And all the Guild members present at his pinning ceremony joined in the laughter. And that was not surprising, because of the three extraordinary features of Klaus's extraordinary laugh. First, it was exceptionally loud and deep, even when he was a boy, coming from the very roots of his soul. Second, it was completely untainted by any sort of meanness--Klaus never laughed at anyone, always with them. And third, it tended to make whoever heard it start laughing, too. So, of course, everyone laughed now.<br><br>Almost everyone. There was one member who did not laugh. His name was Rolf Eckhof, and he was as thin and hard as an iron spike, with white-blond hair and a pursed mouth that looked as if it could never laugh. And though he was a competent woodsman with commissions enough for common items, he had been trying and failing to become a Master for six years. Now this laughing, carefree boy had done it on his first try--the youngest Master in the history of the Guild. <br><br>"But he is just a boy!" Rolf Eckhof sneered.<br><br>"Yes, he's our boy!" the Masters replied proudly. And they laughed and toasted and congratulated Klaus and themselves all over again.<br><br>Rolf Eckhof looked on Klaus's masterpiece and knew he could never make such a beautiful, clever thing. And that knowledge filled him with jealousy and hatred. But he was the sort of man who could wait to take revenge. For now, he said nothing further. But he did not slap Klaus's back, he did not toast him with ale, and certainly he did not laugh.<br><br>Klaus did not notice. And if he had, he would not have comprehended. His nature was open and magnanimous. If ever Jupiter predominated in a personality, it did in his: Klaus was, in every sense of the word, Jovial.<br><br>And so Klaus built himself a small cottage on the hill above the village and set up on his own as a carpenter and joiner and, especially, wood carver. It was soon well known that if you wanted something special--a stool with legs carved to look like those of a bear or a bridal bed with a headboard inlaid with scenes from the Black Forest--you went to Klaus. And so he prospered. He grew never tall, but deep-chested and very strong, and his hair and beard, when it came in, were the color of a fox's pelt. <br><br>But during the summer when Klaus was twenty, something happened that made him stop his fancy carving. The Black Death returned to his village. It did not tarry at his snug cottage, but many another house was visited. The villagers tasted death all that summer and fall and into the winter. Not until the midwinter wind blew down the lanes and snow covered thatch and stone did the Black Death walk on and leave the village in peace. As it happened--and this is one of those quirks a historian finds hard to explain--it never returned.<br><br>But it had turned the village into a Swiss cheese, with holes in most families. Here a father was taken and no one else in the household even sickened; there all but one died, a child of three, leaving her to be adopted by a childless aunt. Indeed, all the twenty-seven children who lost parents in that terrible year found homes of some sort, and none wandered alone; that is how the village was. Many went on to become replacement sisters or brothers, daughters or sons, to those who had lost them. <br><br>All this Klaus saw, and it wrung his heart. But then a splendid new idea occurred to him. It did not make him laugh, for it was not a time for laughing, but a smile creased his ruddy face and a sparkle came into his hazel eyes.<br><br>The next morning he put all his tools into a large flour sack, flung it over his shoulder, and made his way down the hill from his cottage. At the very first house he came to, a small place under a great larch tree, he knocked on the door. A sad-eyed woman holding a baby on her hip answered. "Dame Grusha," said Klaus. "What have you lost?"<br><br>Dame Grusha bit her lip. "I have lost my Jacob," she said.<br><br>He took her small hands in his red, calloused ones. "I am so sorry, Dame Grusha," he said. "I cannot help that. But"--he let go of her hands and heaved his great sack down onto the cold ground in front of her door; it opened, and she could see the tools inside--"what have you lost that these can replace?" <br><br>"I have no table. We burned it because Father Goswin thought it was plague-tainted."<br><br>"Let's go inside and measure," said Klaus.<br><br>For the next months Klaus scarcely saw his own cottage. He spent all his days in the houses of the village, making and mending, or going to the forest for wood and hauling it back. Door to door he went, and always he asked the same question: "What have you lost?" And he heard the same heartrending answers: "I have lost my Johann," "my Gretchen," "my little Conrad," "all my children," "my old father," "everyone but me." <br><br>What could he say to such losses? Only that he was sorry. But what could he do for those who were suffering? A little, he thought, and he did it. <br><br>He made chairs and butter churns and many tables, for many had been burned, like Dame Grusha's, after the sick and dying had lain on them. Soon all in the village were familiar with the sight of the strong young man with flaming red hair and beard coming and going, his sack of tools slung over his back; and all knew his question by heart: "What have you lost that I can replace?" <br><br>He did not think to charge money for his labors, but he ate and slept wherever he worked, and, despite their grief, or perhaps in relief of it, the villagers liked to tease him for his hearty appetite. "You'll grow fat if you keep eating like that," they jested. <br><br>"So be it!" Klaus answered back. "If that is the price I must pay for this good goose, then I say, so be it!" And though he didn't laugh because it wasn't a time yet for laughter, he would smile, and the villagers loved to see his smile in this time of mourning, because they knew it sprang from a heart that wanted only to do them good. It was simple: Klaus knew what to do, and the doing of it made him happy. And all the villagers looked out for him as he stumped down the lanes and across the fields with his flour sack filled with tools, and took a measure of comfort just from seeing him.<br><br>But one in the village did not. "He charges nothing for his labors!" Rolf Eckhof complained to the Governor of the Worshipful Guild of Foresters, Carpenters, and Woodworkers. "And nothing for materials! And this at a time when good business practice dictates we should set our prices higher because of the demand! You must do something! Else he will ruin us all!" <br><br>But the Governor only fixed Rolf Eckhof with a baleful eye. "For shame," he said. And indeed Rolf Eckhof felt a hot streak of shame run through him, and this, too, he blamed on Klaus. But, remember, he was the sort of man who could wait to take his revenge.<br><br>Klaus knew nothing of this. Instead, he brooded on another problem. There were fifty-two surviving children in the village under Mount Feldberg, and Klaus knew them all because he had made and mended in virtually every house. The Black Death had bitten deeper into their lives than those of the grown-ups because they had lived fewer years. They were sadder and quieter than children ought to be, and this troubled Klaus a great deal. Perhaps if they had something to do, he thought--for doing is what had helped to mend his heart. So he engaged as many as he could in his labors, teaching them simple woodworking skills. (And this, Rolf Eckhof would have said, had he known of it, was completely contrary to Guild laws.) And when a child grew too quiet and stared out into nothing for too long, and Klaus knew she was thinking of a lost mother or brother, he would say to her, "Will you go down to the millstream and cut rushes with me? We need them for the Linders' new roof." He could not mend their losses, but he could teach them to help, and the helping, he knew, would go a measure to healing them. And so, in this way, many of the children grew to be really quite useful in bringing the village back to life. And children who did not at first help saw tha...</p><h2>Crowbone (Oathsworn)</h2><p>The long awaited return to Robert Low&#39;s Oathsworn series</p><p>Robert Low has been a journalist and writer since the age of seventeen.

The listener is treated to a reading that feels like a personal revelation. Steinem&#39;s wit and intelligence enliven the words. With the author narrating, the material is more humorous, poignant and alive than the text alone. Certain to gain nods of agreement, or snorts of disbelief, this is superior in all aspects. E.L.C. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThis outstanding collection of essays provides a history of the feminist movement based on Steinem's personal experience. Previously published essays are given new introductions, and the subjects range from an unusual analysis of Freud to discussions about women and sports, class, economics, and ``old age.'' In the first and longest essay, Steinem creates Dr. Phyllis Freud. In a matriarchal world of female dominance and supremacy, this Dr. Freud is a woman of courage greatly respected for her innovative research on undeserving men. Using the gender inversion to illustrate the absurdity of Freud's (Sigmund, that is) theories about sexuality, Steinem critiques social systems based on hierarchy and inequality, arguing that Freudians continue to deny that ``class or race or other social systems'' have had anything to do with the feelings of rage and inferiority experienced by their predominantly female patients. More than a witty satire, what emerges is a compelling examination of the male-dominated institution of mental health. Another essay, a reprint of the expos&#x201a; written when Ms. magazine moved to an ad-free format, remains a compelling reminder of the far-reaching influence of advertisers on the lives of both men and women. Once, after Ms. printed a Front Page Award-winning story about feminists exiled from Russia, Revlon pulled an ad from the magazine because the Soviet women on the cover were not wearing makeup. The struggle to maintain the independence and integrity of the women's magazine will encourage readers to question the untold messages in advertising. In the final piece Steinem reflects on the transition to ``old age'' as a way of analyzing social systems designed to hide away the elderly. But rather than wither and die, Steinem finds herself growing more radical with age. For someone who has accomplished so much in a world not always receptive to visions of feminist change, Steinem keeps getting better and better.

Steffen offers creative tools and introduces practical ways to increase many of the storytelling skills for evangelism- discipleship.

Differing from the older forms of homesickness, homelessness in our times is not just about loss of a particular place, but can be more diffuse, and many don&#x2019;t know why they feel uprooted, unconnected, or incapable of deeper attachment to anybody or anything. In contemporary culture, home? has been reevaluated within an individual and collective context. It has been understood in both its psychological and sociological dimensions as a continuous process of encounter, assessment, and evaluation of the old in terms of the new. The theme can appear in the analytic space, as with dreams and transference, and a working through of its meaning can further a process-oriented way of finding home that protects the local, familiar, and traditional within the context of psychological and cultural innovation.</p><p>John Hill, M.A., is a graduate of the C.

Enjoy this Q&amp;A--as well as a personal note to Amazon readers--from John Grisham. <p></p> <b>1. Your new novel starts off where most courtroom dramas end--with the verdict. Where did you get the idea to reverse the usual order of events this time around?</b><br> The actual trial is not a terribly significant part of the story. Most all of the action and intrigue begins after the trial is over, with the verdict and the subsequent appeal.<br> <b>2. <i>The Appeal</i> overtly suggests that elected judges can be bought. If the novel is meant as a cautionary tale, what's next--the Presidential primaries?</b><br> Why not? Over one billion dollars will be spent next year in the Presidential primaries and general election. With that kind of money floating around, anything can be bought.<br> <b>3. Speaking of electoral politics, you've been more vocal recently about your political views ... first supporting Jim Webb for Senate and now endorsing Hillary Clinton for the White House. Have you given any thought to running for office yourself?</b><br> No. I made that mistake 25 years ago, and promised myself I would never do it again. I enjoy watching and participating in politics from the sidelines, but it's best to keep some distance.<br> <b>4. This is your first legal thriller in three years. How did it feel to get back to the genre that started it all, and can fans expect another thriller from you next year?</b><br> I still enjoy writing the legal thrillers, and don't plan to get too far away from them. Obviously, they have been very good to me, and they remain popular. I plan to write one a year for the next several years.<br> <b>5.

Treating the family as a focal point of multiple social practices and discourses, Donzelot examines the role of philanthropy, social work, compulsory mass education, and psychiatry in the control of family life and describes the transformation of mothers into agents of the state. Donzelot also provides a critique of Marxist, psychoanalytic, and feminist conceptions of the family and shows how the policies of the state and the professions molded working-class and middle-class families in quite different ways.</p><p>"An essential corrective both to the old overly optimistic interpretation and to the new pessimistic and apocalyptic vision of the recent history of the family and society in the West."--Lawrence Stone, New Republic</p></p><p><p>A student and colleague of Michel Foucault shows how public intervention in family affairs since the eighteenth century effected radical changes in a traditionally private domain.</p><p>Jacques Donzelot is professor of political science at the University of Paris-X, Nanterres, and an urban planning advisor for the Ministry of Land Management in Paris.

Antheil, an expatriate avant-garde composer whose works were performed throughout Europe in the 1920s had a disastrous Carnegie Hall concert in 1927 and wrote &#x2018;Death in the Dark&#x2019; out of revenge in 1929. In it he murdered all the people he held responsible. He was helped by Ezra Pound and W.B. Yeats and T.S.Eliot himself wrote &#x201c;This is a very good detective story.&#x201d; Locked Room International discovers and publishes impossible crime mysteries from all over the world. For more information please contact pugmire1@yahoo.com or go to www.mylri.com.</p><p>George Antheil (1900-1959) was an American composer&#x2014;born in Trenton, New Jersey&#x2014;who began his professional career in Europe, where he was friends with, among many others, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, Eric Satie, and Igor Stravinsky. In the early '20s, he lived at the literal center of English-language culture in Europe: above Sylvia Beach's legendary Shakespeare &amp; Co. bookstore on the Rue de l'Odï¿½on, in Paris's Latin Quarter. (Beach was the original publisher of Joyce's controversial and groundbreaking Ulysses.) Antheil wrote over 300 musical works in all major genres, including symphonies, chamber works, film music, and operas. He was extremely outspoken and articulate, and wrote numerous articles, as well as an autobiography, Bad Boy of Music, which is still in print. As a young composer, he considered himself to be quite the revolutionary, and his music, especially in his early career, employed many unusual sound sources and combinations of instruments. In many ways, both musical and technical, he was far ahead of his time. His concerts routinely caused riots all over Europe, which at the time was considered a sign of genius. Besides composing, Antheil was an excellent writer, an inventor, and a student of many disciplines, including endocrinology, criminal justice, and military history. He was co-holder of a remarkable patent (with actress Hedy Lamarr) for a "secret communications system" which is today in wide use and known as "spread-spectrum technology" &#x2014; although neither he nor Lamarr ever received a dime for it. Antheil left Paris in the late '20s and went to Berlin, and then as German society began to fall under the influence of the Nazis, returned permanently to America. He settled in Hollywood, where he enjoyed a reasonably successful career as a composer for film and television. He died in 1959. He wrote 'Death in the Dark' in 1929 while the guest of Ezra Pound in Rapallo, Italy. W.B.Yeats helped with the writing and T.S.Eliot arranged for its publication by Faber and Faber in London in 1930</p><h2>The Complete Works of Rosa Luxemburg, Volume I: Economic Writings 1</h2><p>This first volume in Rosa Luxemburg&#x2019;s <i>Complete Works,</i> entitled&nbsp;<i>Economic Writings 1</i>, contains some of Luxemburg&#x2019;s most important&nbsp;statements on the globalization of capital, wage labor, imperialism,&nbsp;and pre-capitalist economic formations.<br><br>In addition to a new translation of her doctoral dissertation,&nbsp;&#x201c;The Industrial Development of Poland,&#x201d; Volume I includes the first&nbsp;complete English-language publication of her &#x201c;Introduction to&nbsp;Political Economy,&#x201d; which explores (among other issues) the impact&nbsp;of capitalist commodity production and industrialization on noncapitalist&nbsp;social strata in the developing world.

Chomsky contrasts the classical liberal, libertarian socialist, state socialist, and state capitalist world views and then defends a libertarian socialist vision as "the proper and natural extension . . . of classical liberalism into the era of advanced industrial society."<br>In his stirring conclusion Chomsky argues, "We have today the technical and material resources to meet man&#x2019;s animal needs.We have not developed the cultural and moral resources or the democratic forms of social organization that make possible the humane and rational use of our material wealth and power.<br>Conceivably, the classical liberal ideals as expressed and developed in their libertarian socialist form are achievable. But if so, only by a popular revolutionary movement, rooted in wide strata of the population and committed to the elimination of repressive and authoritarian institutions, state and private. To create such a movement is a challenge we face and must meet if there is to be an escape from contemporary barbarism."</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1928, <b>NOAM CHOMSKY</b> is known throughout the world for his political writings, activism, and for for his groundbreaking work in linguistics. A professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1955, Chomsky gained recognition in academic circles for his theory of transformational grammar, which drew attention to the syntactic universality of all human languages. But it is as a critic of unending war, corporate control and neoliberalism that Chomsky has become one of the country&#x2019;s most well known public intellectuals. The 1969 publication of <i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i> marked the beginning of Chomsky&#x2019;s rigorous public criticism of American hegemony and its lieges. Since then, with his tireless scholarship and an unflagging sense of moral responsibility, he has become one of the most influential writers in the world. Chomsky is the author of <i>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media</i> (with Edward S. Herman), <i>Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order</i>, and over one hundred other books. To this day Noam Chomsky remains an active and uncompromising voice of dissent.</p><h2>Gangster Holidays: The Lore and Legends of the Bad Guys</h2><p>This rollicking tale mixes fact and fiction with dozens of FBI photos for a somewhat romantic look at the 1930s gangsters.

Whereas we might ponder the length of hemlines and the fabric du jour, hair often escapes the passionate fashionista&#39;s fastidious and discerning gaze. J.D. &#39;Okhai Ojeikere (born 1930), who worked as an advertising photographer for most of his life, has documented the hairstyles of his native Nigeria in painstaking detail for over thirty years. Plaited, braided, in buns, in towering tresses: In Ojeikere&#39;s photographs hair reveals its sculptural qualities. His deceptively simple, classically composed photographs display hairstyles as a sheer play of forms-minimal, abstract, transient artworks. But Ojeikere&#39;s photographs do not merely purvey aesthetic pleasures. They provide and unexpected insight into Nigerian culture. Detailed captions tell us by whom and for which occasion a particular hairdo was worn, leading the reader into a previously unfamiliar social milieu. In an exhaustive text Ojeikere recounts his life as a photographer, giving us a glimpse of the nascent African mass media culture of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s.</p><p>J.D. &#39;Okhai Ojeikere was born 1930 in Nigeria and has worked as an advertising photographer for most of his life.

John Dickson Carr) is certainly the master of the locked-room mystery, a category which might as well be named after him. In &#34;Death in Five Boxes,&#34; Carr presents not a locked-room mystery but a nonetheless apparently impossible crime. A gathering of five people ends when four of them are found unconscious and nearly dead from atropine poisoning. The fifth faired far less well; he was dead, stabbed. As the room in which the five were found was not locked, the crime should be an easy one. But there&#39;s a slight catch; it seems impossible that anyone, whether a member of the group or an outsider, could have put the poison into the drinks. Sir Henry Merrivale, Carr&#39;s best character, is determined to solve the crime, though, and he naturally does so. Along the way, we learn that the five people who were at the table have many secrets, all of which only serve to cloud the mystery. &#34;Death in Five Boxes&#34; is an excellent novel for those who would like to be able finally to solve one of Carr&#39;s puzzles. The solution is perhaps the most obvious of any of his novels or short stories, though it should be pointed out that &#34;obvious&#34; and Carr&#39;s name do not lend themselves to use in the same paragraph. The novel might be better for aspiring mystery novelists. With such a (relatively) obvious solution, the book becomes an exercise in the mastery of hiding the obvious. Though the novel is far from Carr&#39;s best, either as a simple story or as an impossible mystery, the way in which this undisputed master goes about hiding the truth while playing entirely by the rules is something to behold.</p><p></p><h2>The Battle for Gotham: New York in the Shadow of Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs</h2><p>In the 1970s, New York City hit rock bottom. Crime was at its highest, the middle class exodus was in high gear, and bankruptcy loomed. Many people credit New York's master builder&#x201d; Robert Moses with turning Gotham around, despite his brutal, undemocratic. and demolition-heavy ways.<p>Urban critic and journalist Roberta Brandes Gratz contradicts this conventional view. New York City, Gratz argues, recovered precisely because of the waning power of Moses. His decline in the late 1960s and the drying up of big government funding for urban renewal projects allowed New York to organically regenerate according to the precepts defined by Jane Jacobs in her classic, <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i>, and in contradiction to Moses's urban philosophy.</p><p>As American cities face a devastating economic crisis, Jacobs's philosophy is again vital for the redevelopment of metropolitan life. Gratz who was named as one of Planetizen's Top 100 Urban Thinkers gives an on-the-ground account of urban renewal and community success.</p></p><p><b>Roberta Brandes Gratz</b> is an award-winning journalist, urban critic, and author of the acclaimed book <i>The Living City</i>. Her articles have appeared in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Tikkun</i>, <i>Planning Magazine</i>, and the <i>Daily News</i>, among others. She lives in New York City.The mid-20th-century showdown between New York City planning czar Moses and legendary community urbanist Jacobs reverberates down the decades in this meandering polemic. A journalist and member of New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gratz (<i>The Living City</i>) views 50 years of economic and real estate development as a duel between the legacies of Moses, whose pharaonic highway and urban renewal projects obliterated neighborhoods, and Jacobs, who extolled urban diversity and disorderly mixed uses, hated cars, and championed organic, human-scale development. Through this lens, Gratz rehashes Jacobs's defeat of Moses's Manhattan expressway schemes, examines New York's (anti-)industrial policies and historical preservation laws, and attacks what she sees as latter-day boondoggles like Brooklyn's proposed mammoth Atlantic Yards development and Columbia University's expansion. The avowedly partisan author despises Moses as arrogant and racist, and sometimes cedes the book to Jacobs with lengthy excerpts from interviews with the late urbanist. Gratz offers some cogent critiques of contemporary urban planning (while also embracing a few, like urban farming). Alas, her exposition of Jacobs's ideas is larded with unfocused autobiography, and far less tightly argued than Jacobs's own classic writings.

Yet, for all his barbarian savagery, it took a mere nosebleed to end his life.

Bank, a retired U.S. Army colonel, presents an essentially unfocused chronicle of his military career, which included OSS experience in Europe and Indochina and a role in the founding of the original Special Forces nucleus in the 1950s.

His dazzling career has included the roles of power agent, record-industry mogul, Broadway producer, and billionaire Hollywood studio founder. From the beginning, though, Geffen's many accomplishments have been shadowed by the ruthless single-mindedness with which he has pursued fame, power, and money. In <b>The Operator</b>, Tom King--the first writer to have been granted full access to Geffen and his circle of intimates--captures the real David Geffen and tells a great American story about success and the bargains made for it. <br><br>The extent of Geffen's accomplishments is extraordinary. As a manager in the 1960s, he made the deal for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young to appear at Woodstock. He discovered 1970s superstars Jackson Browne and the Eagles and masterminded Bob Dylan's famed 1974 tour; Joni Mitchell, Geffen's roommate for a time, memorialized him in her song "Free Man in Paris." He produced Risky Business, the movie that made Tom Cruise a star, and was the moneyman behind Cats, the longest-running musical in Broadway history. One of the most brilliant dealmakers ever to work in Hollywood, he became a billionaire shortly after selling Geffen Records in 1990, and he made movie history when he founded, with friends Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, DreamWorks SKG, the first new Hollywood studio in fifty-five years. And Geffen's influence has extended far beyond show business and into the worlds of Wall Street, art, real estate, and politics.<br><br>Geffen's personal journey is as compelling as his business machinations. Although he knew from an early age that he was gay, he hid his true sexual urges and for years attempted to lead a heterosexual life. In the mid-1970s, he dated--and almost married--Cher. Not until 1992, when being honored for his extraordinary financial contributions to the fight against AIDS, did he open the closet door. His coming-out was national news.<br><br>Beneath this phenomenal life story has always been a ferocious drive to succeed, a blind ambition that has left onlookers astounded. Geffen learned from his earliest days in the William Morris mailroom that he could cheat and lie his way to the top, and he has ever after lived unconstrained by traditional notions of right and wrong. Geffen has demonstrated time and again that he is willing to sabotage any relationship, business or personal, to get what he wants.<br><br>At his best, David Geffen is a fiercely devoted friend and a bountifully generous man, both privately and publicly. At his worst, he is a vindictive bully who lashes out at loved ones and colleagues with irrational screaming fits that leave his victims shaking and sweating. And though he has periodically attempted to better himself through psychotherapy and self-help programs like est and Lifespring, he seems always able to find new enemies to rage against.<br><br>For years, David Geffen has managed his own life story and rewritten history. But in The Operator, Tom King has set the record straight. Written with Geffen's cooperation--though not his authorization--<b>The Operator</b> is an explosive, illusion-shattering story that details the mogul's indisputable contributions to entertainment history while also baring the man behind the legend.</p><p>DreamWorks cofounder David Geffen, as portrayed by <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Tom King, is in various ways a saint, a visionary, and an absolute maniac. In his saintly mode, Geffen both raises and gives record-breaking sums of money to AIDS foundations, advises and supports the President and progressive causes, and races to visit old friends stricken with grief or illness (even the washed-up agent Sue Mengers, whose friendship could do him no earthly good). <p> As a visionary in the music, movie, and Broadway theater industries, Geffen orchestrates the sale of his record companies, which made him a billionaire, and brings you Laura Nyro; <i>Cats</i>; Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young; Tom Cruise; the Eagles; Nirvana; Bob Dylan; John Lennon; Guns N' Roses; <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>; and Joni Mitchell (who immortalized his deepest yearnings in her tune "Free Man in Paris"). </p><p> But the most impressive and detailed portion of King's landmark biography is Geffen's performance as an entertainment entrepreneur, and in this capacity he is apparently a visionary and a maniac at the same time. Not only does he discover all manner of talents and works of art and hire the best hit-sniffers in the business, he also masters the fine Hollywood art of the Machiavellian tantrum. Geffen allegedly softens up his prey in a business deal by offering up disarming gossip about his own life--his traumatic courtship of Cher, or Marlo Thomas, perhaps, or the male prostitute he is said to have boasted about being in bed with the night John Lennon was shot. At some point, minutes or decades into an apparent friendship, Geffen is shown betraying anyone, even best friends and mentors, in his relentless quest for winning a deal. King's book provides a ringside seat; it's fascinating to watch Tinseltown's titans slug it out in championship bouts, maneuvering, lying, reuniting, and seizing power like crazed Renaissance princes. </p><p> In one memorable encounter, Geffen protests that Sid Sheinberg of MCA is displeasing his DreamWorks colleague, Steven Spielberg. "David, stop screaming," says Sheinberg. "I'm not screaming!" Geffen screams. "David, you know what would make me happy?" says Speilberg. "Stop screaming." It turns out that Geffen doesn't even know the details of the deal in question. But nobody knows how to strike a deal--with mind and maniacal heart--like David Geffen. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><br><b>From The Operator</b><br><br>Geffen told Cher about the sexual encounters he had had with men and how he was struggling with his sexual identity. He hastily added that his relationships with men had been about sex and nothing more. He was afraid of the opposite sex, he told her, but said that he believed a relationship with a woman would offer him the best chance to find true love. Cher had been surrounded by gay men her entire professional life, and Geffen's confessions left her unfazed. <br><br>"What is it that you do?" Cher finally asked Geffen. <br>"I am the chairman of Elektra/Asylum Records," he told her. <br>"Oh, well, you don't look like it," she said. "You look just like a little schlepper."<br><br>Geffen was charming, offsetting his usual braggadocio with vulnerability. The two stayed up well into the night, exchanging the stories of their lives. Geffen told her he had become a millionaire more than five years earlier. He told her that he thought he had accomplished everything he wanted to achieve, but that somehow the fame and the money was unfulfilling. <br><br>"I'm not alone anymore," Cher thought to herself. She had never known anyone in her life who made her feel so comfortable. <br><br>During his therapy session the next day, Geffen made a startling admission to Dr. Grotjahn. "I think I'm in love with Cher," he said. <br></p><h2>The Adirondacks: A History of America&#39;s First Wilderness</h2><p><br>A New York Times Notable Book<br><br>His book is a romance, a story of first love between Americans and a thing they call "wilderness." For it was in the Adirondacks that masses of non-Native Americans first learned to cherish the wilderness as a place of recreation and solace.<br><br>In this lyrical narrative history, the author reveals that the affair between Americans and the Adirondacks was by no means one of love at first sight. And even now, Schneider shows that Americans' relationship with the glorious mountains and rivers of the Adirondacks continues to change. As in every good romance, nothing is as simple as it appears.<br><br></p><p>The vast Adirondack region of upstate New York is very much a wilderness, but one ringed by towns and close enough to major cities that it is heavily traveled. Long viewed as a natural playground, the Adirondacks were a favorite haunt of transcendentalist philosophers Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, of conservationists such as Franklin Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt, of bohemians and hippies, and of back-to-the-land types. Still wild enough that wolf reintroduction has been proposed for the Adirondacks, the territory remains a powerfully inspiring place of refuge and recreation. Paul Schneider tells the story of this river-laced, forested land with imagination and a flair for just the right anecdote.<br>Paul Schneider lives in West Tisbury, Massachusetts, and New York City. He writes for Harper's, Mirabella (where he works paret-time as deputy editor), and The New York Times Magazine.<br><br></p><h2>A Congress of Wonders</h2><p>Set around World War II, the three hilarious stories in the collection are linked by the presence of one Philander Cosmo Rexroat, B.S., M.S., "Pee Aitch Dee," resurrected here from McClanahan's bestselling book The Natural Man, where he appeared as "the Cecil B. De Mille of Sex Hygiene Entertainment." In these stories, Rexroat turns up in several new guises: preacher, sideshow spieler, and bogus physician.<br>"Juanita and the Frog Prince" tells of a pregnant jailhouse laundress whose ill fate is transformed by a magical encounter with Luther "Two-Nose" Jukes, an inmate awaiting trial for murder. The title story walks us down the carnival midway and a step beyond, as the ubiquitous Rexroat, his consort Wanda Pearl, and a clairvoyant hermaphrodite - "It's that old morphadyke again!" - provide the way station for a boy's journey into the grown-up world of love, loss, and hocus-pocus. "Finch's Song," the tale of Needmore's most beleaguered denizen, a school bus driver endlessly tormented by his ruthless half brother, is both a love story and a story of retribution.</p><p>In McClanahan&#39;s second novel, the antics of Professor Philander Cosmo Rextroat, B.S., M.A. and &#34;Pee Aitch Dee,&#34; an amusing, Kentucky-bred flimflam artist tie together three novella length, modern-day fairy tales. Set during World War II, the opening story, &#34;Juanita and the Frog Prince,&#34; recounts a maid&#39;s deliverance from an unlucky pregnancy through a magical encounter with a dwarf awaiting trial for murder in the jail where she cleans. In the title story, Rextroat is the proprietor of a phony freak show who tries to quell a young boy&#39;s concern for his brother who is going to war. Each neo-gothic tale contains a bittersweet message laced with alchemy and love.A first collection of three long pieces, all set in the 1940s- -``dark and ignorant times'' for the small-town folk that McClanahan (The Natural Man, 1983, etc.) continues to bring to life in his inimitable country-lyrical style. ``Juanita and the Frog Prince,'' the unlikely tale of a ``hoosegow scullery maid'' and a jail inmate with two noses, boldly veers into the fabulistic, with the slutty girl and the freak thug uniting in a weird transmigration of souls. Juanita Pence, knocked up by the ``devious, dissolute, thieving, and mean'' Warren Skidmore Harding, unburdens herself to the toad-ugly Luther ``Two Noses'' Jukes, who's sitting in jail for blowing up Lugnuts Bludgins, another no-count who made fun of Luther's face. As a child, Luther had been sold into sideshow infamy by his crazy mother. On the road, he appeared with the smooth-talking Rev. Philander Cosmo Rexroat, who changed his act from itinerant preacher to freak-show barker. Rexroat's presence links all three stories. ``The Congress of Wonders'' records a day in the life of his sad and seedy sideshow, circa 1944. Mostly ``a pickled-punk show'' of manufactured oddities, its one true attraction is JoJo, a true ``morphadyke,'' who triples as the Bodiless Head and the Bearded Lady. Everyone pays to see the strange hermaphrodite ``pokerate itself,'' but the real wonder is its genuine insight into the future. Finally, in ``Finch's Song: A School Bus Tragedy,'' Rexroat offers his ``Electro-Magno-Static-Diagnosis Machine'' (formerly an electric chair in his sideshow) to diagnose the ailments of Clarence ``Finch'' Fronk, a pitiful and sickly school-bus driver who's tormented by his older half-brother, a bitter and mean pool-hall owner who drives Clarence to a transcendent suicide. McClanahan's old-timey slang and down-home wit endow his trash, drifters, cons, and rubes with poetry and magic. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He presided over two decades of riches, peace, and progress in a city the likes of which no one had ever seen before, with boulevards monumentally conceived and brilliantly lit, clean water, public transportation, and sewers that were the envy of every nation in the world. Yet there is a story that, on his deathbed, Haussmann wished all his work undone. "Would that it had died with me!" he is supposed to have said. What is the secret of the baron's last regret?</p><p>To answer this question, Haussmann tells the story of Madeleine, a foundling who grew up in the magical, chaotic world that Haussmann destroyed; of de Fonce, one of the great <i>artistes dï¿½molisseurs</i> who tore Paris down and sold its rubble as antiques; and of a three-sided affair that pits love against ambition, architecture against flesh, and the living Parisians against Haussmann's unbuilt masterpiece, the Railroad of the Dead. </p><p>Although steeped in history, Paul LaFarge's <i>Haussmann, or the Distinction</i> is a novel not bound by fact; it is an account of the hidden, sometimes fantastical life of the nineteenth century, a work that will make readers think of Borges as well as Balzac; it is a view of cities, of love, and of history itself from the other side of the mirror.</p></p><p>"Haussmann designed cities; LaFarge designs worlds-splendid, elegant edifices built on the rubble of our dreams and history." -Colson Whitehead <p>"Haussmann, or the Distinction is a stunning and wise historical novel. As deeply imagined as Dickens's London, Paul LaFarge's Paris is a cityscape of rubble and grandeur, of poverty and greed, and of the sweeping scene of a changing social order. The aims of this brilliant work go beyond the re-creation of history to the contemplation of what we make of history; why we are seduced by the new, yet yearn for the re-creation of a carnival past. The characters in this moving drama of love, betrayal, and exploitation, are so beautifully drawn they call to mind what fiction should be." -Maureen Howard </p><p>"Paul LaFarge is a grandly inventive, elegant writer, and his nineteenth-century Paris is far more than a fictional echo of history. It is a city full of vivid experience--love, death, ambition, failure, ghosts, cacophony, music, and unforgettable beauty." -Joanna Scott </p><p>"Paul LaFarge's HAUSSMANN is an extraordinary novel. I'm immensely impressed by his erudition, the authenticity of the historical 'pastiche,' and the wit and intelligence of the prose....Fascinating."--Charles Palliser, author of THE QUINCUNX and THE UNBURIED</p><b>Paul La Farge</b> is the author of the novels <i>The Artist of the Missing </i>(FSG, 1999), <i>Haussmann, or the Distinction</i> (FSG, 2001), and <i>Luminous Airplanes </i>(FSG, 2011); and a book of imaginary dreams, <i>The Facts of Winter</i>.

But what Disney insiders saw as a mismanaged family business looked to Wall Street like a prime takeover candidate; the family squabble set off a chain of events that had such formidable financiers as Saul Steinberg, the Bass Brothers, even Ivan Boesky grappling for keys to the Magic Kingdom. Taylor, of Manhattan Inc., provides a detailed, conference-call-by-conference-call account of the ensuing paper war, in a narrative as fast-paced and exciting as a classic Disney adventure, with the company itself playing the Hayley Mills part: the imperiled, innocent heroine who at the end emerges harried but unharmedand more than a little wiser for the wear. Keeping financial jargon to a minimum, Taylor makes the Byzantine mechanics of contemporary finance easy to follow, shedding light on the takeover phenomenon and on the risks facing companies whose dearest assets are the creative talents of their employees.

This book analyzes our attempt to understand society so that we can reshape it. In so doing, the author largely bypasses both epistemology and contemporary highly abstract theory on knowledge and society in order to achieve a far more concrete analysis of discourse and inquiry in social problem solving. There is a tragic discrepancy, argues the author, between our abilities to solve problems and the difficulty of the problems to be solved. We must make do with inadequate information and inconclusive analyses, for the task is less one of learning the truth than of proceeding in inquiry and decisions when the truth cannot be known. He discusses the many obstacles that prevent us from solving social problems, focusing in particular on learned incompetence. According to the author, parents teach children not to think certain thoughts, and schools often engage more in indoctrination than education. Political rhetoric and commercial sales promotion feed a steady diet of misrepresentation. Social science does help. But because it is dependent on popular thought, it shares the impairments of thought found in both political figures and ordinary citizens. It also develops its own distinctive impairments. Although social science can be improved in ways that the author outlines in his book, social inquiry calls for such significant contributions from lay thought that it renders many conventional ideals of scientific problem solving inappropriate. The author contends that the route to better social problem solving is not through either scientific or popular consensus or agreement, however much they are valued in the world of science and social science, but through a competition of ideas. The index of a society&#39;s competence he states, is in its discord over ends, values, or purposes.</p><p>How do ordinary citizens, officials, opinion leaders, social scientists, and other experts try to solve our social problems? In this prize-winning book, a distinguished social scientist analyzes our attempts--and our many failures--to understand society well enough to reshape it.How do ordinary citizens in a democratic society go about gathering facts and grappling with social and political problems? Very poorly, contends Yale political scientist Lindblom. He charges that ignorance, peer pressure, illiteracy and the use of media for propaganda purposes deter most citizens from the kinds of inquiry necessary for rational problem-solving. Though couched in social-science jargon, this provocative, clearsighted treatise offers a devastating critique of massive public apathy and the restricted flow of information. In Lindblom's analysis, schools breed docile conformists, and the conditioning of children into law-abiding adults impairs their capacity to think independently. The book, a yardstick for knowledge-seekers in all fields, argues that every concept of the public welfare favors some groups over others, and knocks social scientists who pretend to neutral detachment. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sunday Philosophy Club (The Isabel Dalhousie Series)</h2><p>Introducing the new series from the international bestselling author of The No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency books &#x2014; the Sunday Philosophy Club series is set in Edinburgh, Scotland, and stars Isabel Dalhousie, editor of <i>The Review of Applied Ethics</i> and part-time detective.<br><br>Isabel enjoys wading through the mysteries of life, everything from the morning&#x2019;s crossword to higher philosophical dilemmas, often with the advice of her ethically upright housekeeper, Grace.

In the aftermath, he begins to doubt his career choices and realises that he needs a break from the stifling problems of his work. Granted leave from the Questura, Brunetti is shipped off by his wife, Paola, to a villa owned by a wealthy relative on Sant&#39;Erasmo, one of the largest islands in the Venetian laguna. There, he intends to pass his days rowing, and his nights reading Pliny&#39;s Natural History. The recuperative stay goes according to plan and Brunetti is finally able to relax, until Davide Casati, the caretaker of the house, goes missing following a sudden storm. Nobody can find him - not his daughter, not his friends, and not the woman he&#39;d been secretly visiting. Now, Brunetti feels compelled to investigate, to set aside his holiday and discover what happened to the man who had recently become his friend. In Earthly Remains, Donna Leon shows Venice through an insider&#39;s eyes. From family meals and vaporetti rides to the never-ending influx of tourists and suffocating political corruption, the details and rhythms of everyday Venetian life are at the core of this thrilling novel, and of the terrible crime at its heart.</p><p>Donna Leon was named by The Times as one of the 50 Greatest Crime Writers. She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.Brunetti hurried after Casati, who was walking towards a rope tied to one of the stanchions. As he reached him, Brunetti looked into the water and saw floating a meter below them an unpainted puparin, the wood glowing in the sun. Closest kin to the gondola, though a bit shorter, the puparin was Brunetti's favorite rowing boat, responsive and light in the water; he had never seen a lovelier one than this. Even the cross board glowed in the light, almost as though Casati had given it a quick polish before he left the boat.<br> <br> Casati set the suitcase on the riva and crouched down at the edge. For a moment, Brunetti thought he was going to jump down into the boat, as if a young man's stunt would show Brunetti who was the real boatman. Instead, Casati sat on the riva, put one hand, palm flat, on the pavement and hopped down into the boat. He steadied himself before reaching up towards the suitcase. Brunetti moved fast and handed it to him, sat on the riva, judged the distance, and stepped down onto the horizontal board that spanned the boat.<br> <br> Involuntarily, it escaped Brunetti, "My God, she's beautiful." He couldn't stop his right hand from running along the top board that ran along the side, delighting in its cool smoothness. Looking back at Casati, he asked, "Who built her?"<br> <br> "I did," he answered. "But that was a long time ago."<br> <br> Brunetti said nothing in reply, busy studying the lines where the boards were invisibly caulked together, the hull's gentle curve to the right, the floor planking that showed no sign of moisture or dirt.<br> <br> "Complimenti," Brunetti said, turning away to face forward. He heard noises from behind, then Casati asked him to haul in the rubber tire that served as a buffer between the side of the boat and the stone wall. When Brunetti turned again, he saw Casati pull in the second tire and set it on the bottom of the boat, next to a piece of iron grating standing upright against the side. Brunetti faced forward again and heard the slap of the mooring rope tossed to the bottom of the boat, and then the smooth noise of the oar slipping into the fï¿½rcola. A sudden motion pushed them away from the wall, and then he thought he heard Casati's oar slide into the water, and they were off.<br> <br> All he heard after that was the soft rubbing of the oar in the curve of the fï¿½rcola, the hiss of water along the sides of the boat, and the occasional squeak of one of Casati's shoes as his weight shifted forwards or backwards. Brunetti gave himself to motion, glad of the passing breeze that tempered the savagery of the heat. He hadn't thought to bring a hat, and he had scoffed at Paola's insistence that he bring sun screen." <br> <br> Brunetti had rowed since he was a boy, but he knew he had little to contribute to the smoothness of this passage. There was not the slightest suggestion of stop and go, of a point where the thrust of the oar changed force: it was a single forward motion, like a bird soaring on rising drafts of air, or a pair of skis descending a slope. It was a whish or a shuuh, as hard to describe as to hear, even in the midst of the silence of the laguna. <br> <br> Brunetti turned his head to one side, then to the other, but there was only the soft, low hiss. He wanted to turn and look at Casati, as though by watching him row, he might store the motions away and copy them later, but he didn't want to shift his weight and thus change the balance of the boat, however minimally.<br> <br> A fisherman stood on the riva, looking both bored and impatient. When he saw the puparin, he raised his pole in salutation to Casati, but the heat rendered him silent as a fish.<br> <br> They reached the end of the island and turned eastward, following the shoreline past houses and abandoned fields. Even the turning had been effortless. Brunetti watched houses and trees glide past and only then did he realize how fast they were moving. He turned, then, to watch Casati row.<br> <br> Seeing the perfect balance of his motion, back and forth, back and forth, hands effortlessly in control of the oar, Brunetti thought that no man his own age or younger would be able to row like this because he would spoil it by showing off. The drops from the blade hit the water almost invisibly before the oar dipped in and moved towards the back. His father had rowed like this.<br> <br> This was perfection, Brunetti realized, as beautiful as any painting he had ever seen or voice he had ever heard.</p><h2>Wind-Vane Self-Steering: How to Plan and Make Your Own</h2><p>Belcher really did &#34;write the book&#34; on self steering systems and provides simple to follow diagrams and patterns for vertical, horizontal, and servo-pendulum systems.

Its 41 contributors, of whom the youngest was born in 1923, belie the common prejudice that the world of old age shrinks to contain chiefly the self, its nagging physical infirmities and its endless rumination upon past failures and successes. The enduring power of love is a far more common subject here than illness and debility. "I could not conceive of old age without the many friends I conjure up from a section of my brain," explains engraver Fritz Eichenberg. Concern with personal achievement fades before preoccupation with humanity's shared fate. "How can I age with decency in an indecent society whose culture is constantly being sullied by the most fraudulent self-seeking?" asks composer David Diamond. Other distinguished contributors include psychologist Albert Ellis, movie critic Judith Crist, physician Henry J. Heimlich, actress Rosemary DeCamp and romance novelist Phyllis A. Whitney.

In 140 B.C., narrator Tomryis, age 18, is chosen by Saka King Mauakes of Ferghana (now Afghanistan), to attend his new wife, Heliokleia, a Greek from the kingdom of Bactra. The marriage is a political alliance, and Mauakes makes it clear that beautiful, intelligent Heliokleia is to have only limited powers. The aloof queen decides to seek her soul's release by being the perfect ruler. Mauakes's grown son Itaz, devoted to his father, is sensitive to both the king's isolation behind the mask of power and Heliokleia's emotional suffering. Eventually Mauakes falls in love with his wife, but he can't demand her affection, which has settled on Itaz. Aided by their sun god patron, Heliokleia and Itaz must confront the paranoid, embittered Mauakes and endure a horrible confrontation with a supernatural creature. Well-researched, interesting details on the cultural and religious customs of the period provide background for the noble characters, who fulfill the promise, good or evil, of their true natures. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- A fine story, set in Central Asia 200 years after the time of Alexander the Great. Warring barbarians want their rulers to conquer and rule as Alexander had once done. Faction against faction sets the region on fire with war. One ruler, stronger and smarter than the others, tries to secure his borders by treaties and royal marriages. His Greek border is peacefully aligned to his kingdom by his marriage to the sister of the Greek ruler. All is fine until she arrives; not only is the princess mounted on elephants that terrify even the soldiers and their horses, but she is beautiful, too. The tale begins as the aging ruler, amidst great pagentry, marries the young princess. His lack of personal hygene offends her, but loyalty to her people and a great sense of duty keep her from fleeing or killing herself.

Naipaul published <em>An Area of Darkness</em>, his semi-autobiographical account of a year in India. Two visits later, prompted by the Emergency of 1975, he came to write <em>India: A Wounded Civilization</em>, in which he casts a more analytical eye over Indian attitudes. In this work, he recapitulates and further investigates the feelings that the vast, mysterious and agonised continent has previously aroused in him. What he sees and what he hears - evoked so superbly and vividly in this book - only reinforce in him his conviction that India, wounded by a thousand years of foreign rule, has not yet found an ideology of regeneration.</p><p>`A devastating work` <em>The Times </em></p><p>`Brilliant` <em>Spectator</em></p></p><p>In 1975, at the height of Indira Gandhi&#39;s Emergency, V. S. Naipaul returned to India, the country his ancestors had left one hundred years before. Out of that journey he produced this concise masterpiece of journalism and cultural analysis, a vibrant, defiantly unsentimental portrait of a society traumatized by repeated foreign invasions and immured in a mythic vision of its past. Drawing on novels, news reports, and political memoirs -- but most of all on his conversations with ordinary Indians, from princes to engineers and feudal village autocrats -- Naipaul captures India&#39;s manifold complexities.V.S. Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932. He is the author of thirteen works of fiction, including A House for Mr Biswas, A Bend in the River and The Mystic Masseur, and ten books of non-fiction including An Area of Darkness and Among the Believers. He has won the Booker Prize, the John Llewelyn Rhys Memorial Prize, the Hawthornden Prize, the WH Smith award and in 1993 was awarded the first David Cohen British Literature Award. His new novel, Half A Life, was published in September 2001. Shortly afterwards he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Hungarians struggled to survive a long alliance with Germany, Soviet occupation, assumption of power by the Communist part, and the bloody revolution of 1956. The years since that uprising have witnessed the consolidation of a single-party socialist state producing a profound effect not only on the economic and social life of the nation but also on the cultural policies that govern the arts.This volume collects the work of Hungarian authors who, in spite of the turmoil and uncertainty of those years, have developed a rich and varied imaginative literature. Albert Tezla has chosen to concentrate on ten major writers who established their reputations during the first two decades after the war and have been influential in current literary developments. They are: Sï¿½ndor Csoï¿½ri, Ferenc Juhï¿½sz, Lï¿½szlï¿½ Nagy, ï¿½gnes Nemes Nagy, Jï¿½nos Pilinszky, Istvï¿½n Csurka, Ivï¿½n Mï¿½ndy, Miklï¿½s Mï¿½szï¿½ly, Istvï¿½n ï¿½rkï¿½ny, and Ferenc Sï¿½nta. In addition, he presents a sampling of the work of 14 writers first published after 1965. The collection includes both poetry and prose along with critical essays and author interviews; nearly all the selections are complete pieces.The editor provides a substantial introduction to the major literary developments in postwar Hungary within the context of the changing political climate, and a biographical-critical essay for each writer. The volume also includes a short guide to Hungarian pronunciation and a comprehensive bibliography of twentieth-century Hungarian literature in translation.</p><p>Text: English, Hungarian (translation)</p><h2>Smart Alec Grade 4 Math Word Problems Workbook (Smart Alec Series Educational Workbooks)</h2><p>Smart Alec&#34; books are more than just workbooks.

However, as shown in this book (pp. 10 ff.), there is no evidence whatsoever of any invasion or of the presence of an alien culture at any of the hundreds of Harappan sites. While one is glad to note that the Invasion theory is dead, it is a pity that it is being resurrected in a new avatar, namely that of Immigration , of people from the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex of Central Asia, who, the proponents think, were nomadic Aryans. This book advances cogent arguments to demonstrate that this new theory too is totally wrong (pp. 19 ff.). For all this mess, the dating of the Rigveda to 1,200 BCE by Max Muller is squarely responsible. The combined evidence of hydrology, archaeology and C-14 method of dating shows that the Rigveda is assignable to the 3rd-4th millennium BCE (pp. 118 ff.). The Rigveda (X. 75. 5-6) also tells us that the Vedic people occupied the entire territory from the Indus on the west to the upper reaches of the Ganga-Yamuna on the east. Archaeologically, during the aforesaid period and within the above-noted territory, there existed one and only one civilization, namely the Harappan. Hence, the Harappan Civilization and the Vedas are but two faces of the same coin (pp. 122-23). Further, the evidence from Kunal and Bhirrana (pp. 54-55) establishes that the roots of this civilization go back to the 6th-5th millennia BCE, indicating thereby that the Harappans were the sons of the soil and not aliens. Thus, the Vedic people, who were themselves the Harappans, were Indigenous and neither Invaders nor Immigrants .</p><p>A world-renowned archaeologist, Prof. B.B. Lal was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1968 to 1972. In the latter year he took voluntary retirement to pursue his research programmes independently. First he joined Jiwaji University, Gwalior, as a Professor and later the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, of which he was also the Director. Professor Lal s excavations cover a very wide range from palaeolithic times to early historical. At Kalibangan, Rajasthan, he unearthed a prosperous city of the Harappan Civilization. The excavations at Hastinapura, Indraprastha, etc. have established that there was a kernel of truth in the Mahabharata, even though the epic is full of interpolations. Likewise, his excavations at Ayodhya, Sringaverapura, etc. have indicated that the Ramayana too has a basis in history. In 1961, he conducted excavations in Egypt also, which threw welcome light on Egyptian prehistory. His publications include over 150 seminal research papers, published in scientific journals, both in India and abroad: USA, UK, France, Italy, Russia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Japan, etc. Amongst his latest books are: The Sarasvati Flows On: The Continuity of Indian Culture (2002); The Homeland of the Aryans: Evidence of Rigvedic Flora and Fauna and Archaeology (2005); Rama: His Historicity, Mandir and Setu (2008); How Deep are the Roots of Indian Civilization: Archaeology Answers (2009); Piecing Together: Memoirs of an Archaeologist (2011); Historicity of the Mahabharata: Evidence of Literature, Art and Archaeology (2013). In 1994, Prof. Lal was awarded D. Litt. (Honoris causa) by Institute of Archaeology, St. Petersburg, Russia. The same year he presided over World Archaeological Congress. He has been Chairman and member of several committees of UNESCO. In 1982, Mithila Visvavidyalaya honoured him with the title of Mahamahopadhyaya. In 1991, two distinctions were conferred on him, respectively by the Indian Science Congress and Asiatic Society, Bombay. In recognition of his contribution to archaeology, the President of India honoured him in 2000 with the award of Padma Bhusana.</p><h2>Human Origins: What Bones and Genomes Tell Us about Ourselves</h2><p>Ever since the recognition of the Neanderthals as an archaic human in the mid-nineteenth century, the fossilized bones of extinct humans have been used by paleoanthropologists to explore human origins. These bones told the story of how the earliest humans bipedal apes, actually first emerged in Africa some 6 to 7 million years ago. Starting about 2 million years ago, the bones revealed, as humans became anatomically and behaviorally more modern, they swept out of Africa in waves into Asia, Europe and finally the New World.<br><br>Even as paleoanthropologists continued to make important discoveries Mary Leakey&#x2019;s Nutcracker Man in 1959, Don Johanson&#x2019;s Lucy in 1974, and most recently Martin Pickford&#x2019;s Millennium Man, to name just a few experts in genetics were looking at the human species from a very different angle. In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick first saw the double helix structure of DNA, the basic building block of all life. In the 1970s it was shown that humans share 98.7% of their genes with the great apes that in fact genetically we are more closely related to chimpanzees than chimpanzees are to gorillas. And most recently the entire human genome has been mapped we now know where each of the genes on the chromosomes that make up DNA is located on the double helix.<br><br>In <i>Human Origins</i>: <i>What Bones and Genomes Tell Us about Ourselves</i>, two of the world&#x2019;s foremost scientists, geneticist Rob DeSalle and paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, show how research into the human genome confirms what fossil bones have told us about human origins. This unprecedented integration of the fossil and genomic records provides the most complete understanding possible of humanity&#x2019;s place in nature, its emergence from the rest of the living world, and the evolutionary processes that have molded human populations to be what they are today.<br><br><i>Human Origins</i> serves as a companion volume to the American Museum of Natural History&#x2019;s new permanent exhibit, as well as standing alone as an accessible overview of recent insights into what it means to be human.<br><br></p><p>ROB DESALLE is co-director of the Molecular Systematics Laboratories and curator of the Division of Invertebrate Zoology.IAN TATTERSALL is curator in the Division of Anthropology, both at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.". . . an authoritative and fun publication that will be accessible to anyone with even the faintest recollection of high school biology or any curiosity whatsoever about how we came to be the way we are." --<i>The Quarterly Review of Biology</i></p><h2>The Spirit-Filled Life</h2><p><b>The Real Meaning of Life</b>You can be a Spirit-filled and fruit-bearing Christian, bringing great glory to God.

Finney</b> (1792&#x2013;1875) was a man with a message that burned through the religious deadwood and secular darkness of his time. He had the ability to shock both saint and sinner alike. Because he was radical in both his methods and his message, Finney was criticized for almost everything except being boring.<br> Born in Connecticut in 1792, Finney was nearly thirty years of age when he turned from his skepticism regarding Christianity and wholeheartedly embraced the Bible as the true Word of God. He gave up his law profession in order to spread the gospel, and he soon became the most noteworthy revivalist of the nineteenth century, one of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening. It is estimated that over 250,000 souls were converted as a result of his preaching. While Finney carried his revivals to several middle and eastern states, the bulk of his meetings were in New York towns, especially Rome, Rochester, Utica, Clinton, Antwerp, Evans&#x2019; Mills, Western, and Gouverneur.<br> In 1832, Finney began pastoring Second Free Presbyterian Church in New York City. In 1835, upon the request of Arthur Tappan, Finney established the theology department at Oberlin Collegiate Institute (today known as Oberlin College). He served there as a professor of theology, as well as pastor of Oberlin's First Congregational Church, until a few years before his death. He was also a member of the Oberlin College Board of Trustees from 1846 until he was elected president in 1851. During these years, he continued to carry on his evangelism, even visiting Great Britain twice in 1849&#x2013;50 and 1859&#x2013;60.<br> Finney was married three times in his life, first to Lydia Root Andrews (m. 1824), then to Elizabeth Ford Atkinson (m. 1848), and then to Rebecca Allen Rayl (m. 1865). All three of these women assisted Finney in his evangelistic efforts, accompanying him on his revival tours during their lives. In August 1875, Finney died in Oberlin due to a heart ailment.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Kasparov teaches chess (A Batsford chess book)</h2><p>A series of 24 chess lessons, first published in &#34;Sport in the USSR&#34;, covering all aspects of the game.

The plains Indians, who relied on the buffalo as a source of food and spiritual power, weakened and succumbed to the aggressors as the buffalo quickly disappeared from the prairies. "Buffalo Nation" tells the story of this brutal war, and details the amazing comeback of the buffalo. The number of bison in the U.S. plummeted from more than thirty million in the early 1800s to fewer than 500 at the turn of the century. There are now more than 250,000 bison on ranches and sanctuaries across the nation. Valerius Geist also examines the natural history of the buffalo&#x2014;underscoring its importance in North America in this enlightening exploration that will appeal to history buffs, conservationists, wildlife enthusiasts, and those concerned with Native American issues. The book features writings by "Buffalo Bill" Cody, Mari Sandoz, George Catlin, Black Elk, Lewis and Clark, General George Custer, Chief Plenty-coups, John James Audubon, Daniel Boone, Francis Parkman, and more. Illustrations include those by Charles M. Russell, Albert Bierstadt, George Catlin, and various Native American artists, along with more than 80 historical and contemporary photographs.</p><p>This remarkable examination of the history and cultural impact of an animal species nearly lost for good uses a wide variety of sources in tracing the buffalo from the Ice Age to the present. Geist describes the historic adaptations that occurred in various classes of buffalo, the biology of the North American bison, the impact of human hunters, and the close relationship that developed between bison and Native American tribes. The slaughter of the great herds that began in the mid^-nineteenth century is truly horrifying today, and many people at the time were also sickened by it. Geist convincingly shows that this near extinction was the result of government efforts to deprive Native American tribes of food, forcing them onto reservations and opening the West to settlers. Sprinkled throughout are buffalo myths and stories. A fine history made even better by the array of drawings and stunning full-color photos. <i>Brian McCombie</i>"Fascinating and authoritative . . . Geist skillfully interweaves this scientific narrative with Native American buffalo myths and U.S. policies to exterminate the animals." -- <i>Outdoor Life</i><br><br>"Interesting and worth reading. . . .

ROSELAND</b> <p>The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside the swimming pool might have been dead.</p> <p>He might have been drowned and fished out of the pool and laid out on the grass to dry while the police or the next-of-kin were summoned. Even the little pile of objects in the grass beside his head might have been his personal effects, meticulously assembled in full view so that no one should think that something had been stolen by his rescuers.</p> <p>To judge by the glittering pile, this had been, or was, a rich man. It contained the typical membership badges of the rich man's club - a money clip, made of a Mexican fifty-dollar piece and holding a substantial wad of banknotes, a well-used gold Dunhill lighter, an oval gold cigarette case with the wavy ridges and discreet turquoise button that means Faberge, and the sort of novel a rich man pulls out of the bookcase to take into the garden - The Little Nugget - an old P.G. Wodehouse. There was also a bulky gold wristwatch on a well-used brown crocodile strap. It was a Girard-Perregaux model designed for people who like gadgets, and it had a sweep second-hand and two little windows in the face to tell the day of the month, and the month, and the phase of the moon. The story it now told was 2.30 on June 10th with the moon three-quarters full.</p> <p>A blue and green dragon-fly flashed out from among the rose bushes at the end of the garden and hovered in mid-air a few inches above the base of the man's spine. It had been attracted by the golden shimmer of the June sunshine on the ridge of fine blond hairs above the coccyx. A puff of breeze came off the sea. The tiny field of hairs bent gently. The dragonfly darted nervously sideways and hung above the man's left shoulder, looking down. The young grass below the man's open mouth stirred. A large drop of sweat rolled down the side of the fleshy nose and dropped glittering into the grass. That was enough. The dragonfly flashed away through the roses and over the jagged glass on top of the high garden wall. It might be good food, but it moved.</p> <p>The garden in which the man lay was about an acre of well-kept lawn surrounded on three sides by thickly banked rose bushes from which came the steady murmur of bees. Behind the drowsy noise of the bees the sea boomed softly at the bottom of the cliff at the end of the garden.</p> <p>There was no view of the sea from the garden - no view of anything except of the sky and the clouds above the twelve-foot wall. In fact you could only see out of the property from the two upstairs bedrooms of the villa that formed the fourth side of this very private enclosure. From them you could see a great expanse of blue water in front of you and, on either side, the upper windows of neighbouring villas and the tops of the trees in their gardens - Mediterranean-type evergreen oaks, stone pines, casuarinas and an occasional palm tree.</p> <p>The villa was modern - a squat elongated box without ornament. On the garden side the flat pink-washed facade was pierced by four iron-framed windows and by a central glass door leading on to a small square of pale green glazed tiles. The tiles merged into the lawn. The other side of the villa, standing back a few yards from a dusty road, was almost identical. But on this side the four windows were barred, and the central door was of oak.</p> <p>The villa had two medium-sized bedrooms on the upper floor and on the ground floor a sitting-room and a kitchen, part of which was walled off into a lavatory. There was no bathroom.</p> <p>The drowsy luxurious silence of early afternoon was broken by the sound of a car coming down the road. It stopped in front of the villa. There was the tinny clang of a car door being slammed and the car drove on. The doorbell rang twice. The naked man beside the swimming pool did not move, but, at the noise of the bell and of the departing car, his eyes had for an instant opened very wide. It was as if the eyelids had pricked up like an animal's ears. The man immediately remembered where he was and the day of the week and the time of the day. The noises were identified. The eyelids with their fringe of short sandy eyelashes drooped drowsily back over the very pale blue, opaque, inward-looking eyes. The small cruel lips opened in a wide jaw-breaking yawn which brought saliva into the mouth. The man spat the saliva into the grass and waited.</p> <p>A young woman carrying a small string bag and dressed in a white cotton shirt and a short, unalluring blue skirt came through the glass door and strode mannishly across the glazed tiles and the stretch of lawn towards the naked man. A few yards away from him, she dropped her string bag on the grass and sat down and took off her cheap and rather dusty shoes. Then she stood up and unbuttoned her shirt and took it off and put it, neatly folded, beside the string bag.</p> <p>The girl had nothing on under the shirt. Her skin was pleasantly sunburned and her shoulders and fine breasts shone with health. When she bent her arms to undo the side-buttons of her skirt, small tufts of fair hair showed in her armpits. The impression of a healthy animal peasant girl was heightened by the chunky hips in faded blue stockinet bathing trunks and the thick short thighs and legs that were revealed when she had stripped.</p> <p>The girl put the skirt neatly beside her shirt, opened the string bag, took out an old soda-water bottle containing some heavy colourless liquid and went over to the man and knelt on the grass beside him. She poured some of the liquid, a light olive oil, scented, as was everything in that part of the world, with roses, between his shoulder blades and, after flexing her fingers like a pianist, began massaging the sternomastoid and the trapezius muscles at the back of the man's neck.</p> <p>It was hard work. The man was immensely strong and the bulging muscles at the base of the neck hardly yielded to the girl's thumbs even when the downward weight of her shoulders was behind them. By the time she was finished with the man she would be soaked in perspiration and so utterly exhausted that she would fall into the swimming pool and then lie down in the shade and sleep until the car came for her. But that wasn't what she minded as her hands worked automatically on across the man's back. It was her instinctive horror for the finest body she had ever seen.</p> <p>None of this horror showed in the flat, impassive face of the masseuse, and the upward-slanting black eyes under the fringe of short coarse black hair were as empty as oil slicks, but inside her the animal whimpered and cringed and her pulse-rate, if it had occurred to her to take it, would have been high.</p> <p>Once again, as so often over the past two years, she wondered why she loathed this splendid body, and once again she vaguely tried to analyse her revulsion. Perhaps this time she would get rid of feelings which she felt guiltily certain were much more unprofessional than the sexual desire some of her patients awoke in her.</p> <p>To take the small things first: his hair. She looked down at the round, smallish head on the sinewy neck. It was covered with tight red-gold curls that should have reminded her pleasantly of the formalised hair in the pictures she had seen of classical statues. But the curls were somehow too tight, too thickly pressed against each other and against the skull. They set her teeth on edge like fingernails against pile carpet. And the golden curls came down so low into the back of the neck - almost (she thought in professional terms) to the fifth cervical vertebra. And there they stopped abruptly in a straight line of small stiff golden hairs.</p> <p>The girl paused to give her hands a rest and sat back on her haunches. The beautiful upper half of her body was already shining with sweat. She wiped the back of her forearm across her forehead and reached for the bottle of oil. She poured about a tablespoonful on to the small furry plateau at the base of the man's spine, flexed her fingers and bent forward again.</p> <p>This embryo tail of golden down above the cleft of the buttocks - in a lover it would have been gay, exciting, but on this man it was somehow bestial. No, reptilian. But snakes had no hair. Well, she couldn't help that. It seemed reptilian to her. She shifted her hands on down to the two mounds of the gluteal muscles. Now was the time when many of her patients, particularly the young ones on the football team, would start joking with her. Then, if she was not very careful, the suggestions would come. Sometimes she could silence these by digging sharply down towards the sciatic nerve. At other times, and particularly if she found the man attractive, there would be giggling arguments, a brief wrestling-match and a quick, delicious surrender.</p> <p>With this man it was different, almost uncannily different. From the very first he had been like a lump of inanimate meat. In two years he had never said a word to her. When she had done his back and it was time for him to turn over, neither his eyes nor his body had once shown the smallest interest in her. When she tapped his shoulder, he would just roll over and gaze at the sky through half-closed lids and occasionally let out one of the long shuddering yawns that were the only sign that he had human reactions at all.</p> <p>The girl shifted her position and slowly worked down the right leg towards the Achilles tendon. When she came to it, she looked back up the fine body. Was her revulsion only physical? Was it the reddish colour of the sunburn on the naturally milk-white skin, the sort of roast meat look? Was it the texture of the skin itself, the deep, widely spaced pores in the satiny surface? The thickly scattered orange freckles on the shoulders? Or was it the sexuality of the man? The indifference of these splendid, insolently bulging muscles? Or was it spiritual - an animal instinct telling her that inside this wonderful body there was an evil person?</p> <p>The masseuse got to her feet and stood, twisting her head slowly from side to side and flexing her shoulders. She stretched her arms out s...</p></p><h2>Jemmy</h2><p>Forced to quit school to take care of her motherless family, Jemmy Stott is befriended by a well-known painter and his wife who tell the young Chippewa girl that she has great potential as an artist</p><p>ippewa mother is dead, seventeen-year-old Jemmy&#39;s alcoholic father has insisted that she quit school to care for her younger siblings.

Now, armed with a fly-fishing rod and reel, he embarks with his seven-year-old daughter on an equally memorable journey across America in search of clear-running streams, swift elusive fish, and the eternal truths that only nature can provide.<br><br>It has been said that life is what happens while you're waiting to go fishing. Only weeks after his eleven-year marriage abruptly ended in an amicable divorce, James Dodson decided to go on a fly-fishing pilgrimage west. His goal: to heal his wounded spirit and explain as best he could the vagaries of life and love to his beautiful, precocious seven-year-old daughter, Maggie.<br><br>With his beat-up truck, Old Blue, and his aging retriever, Amos, Dodson and Maggie travel without plans or reservations, following where the spirit--and the lure of America's mighty rivers--leads them, on their way to one of America's grandest treasures: Yellowstone National Park. On the way, Dodson discovers a great deal about fishing, about America, and about the special relationship that exists only between a father and daughter. <br><br>They travel from the Adirondacks, once a fly-angler's haven, to the mist-shrouded Niagara Falls. From the Michigan lakes where Ernest Hemingway roamed as a boy to small-town county fairs. From the majesty of Mount Rushmore to the mysticism of Harney's Peak, where Black Elk had his legendary visions, to finally the fly-fisherman's paradise of the San Juan River. Together father and daughter are bound by a tie as resilient and unpredictable as a fly-fisherman's line. For as the emotional waters in which they fish become ever more turbulent, Maggie's unspoken feelings of grief, anger, and blame begin to surface--a depth of hurt that forces Dodson to face his own unacknowledged pain and, worse, leaves him feeling helpless to make everything all right in his daughter's life again. <br><br>Yet if fly-fishing has taught James Dodson anything, it is the rewards of patience, of following the wisdom of the course of the stream, the unexpected revelations reflected in still pools, and, of course, an abiding belief in plain dumb luck. With a little of each, these faithful travelers will find their way home again.<br><br>Literate, honest, and deeply observant, <i>Faithful Travelers</i> is a beautiful meditation on the bond between parent and child and the nature of love and loss. In <i>Faithful Travelers,</i> James Dodson proves that sometimes life isn't what happens while you're waiting to go fishing: sometimes it happens while you're there.</p><p>James Dodson, author of the father-son golfing memoir <i>Final Rounds</i>, took his 7-year-old daughter, Maggie, on a cross-country camping and fishing trip soon after he and his wife announced their plans for an amicable divorce. The six-week interlude of father-daughter roaming creates a story that limns both the scenic vistas of the American West and the interior landscape of the heart.<p> As the two drive and fish and walk their old dog, Amos, Maggie asks her father difficult questions, and Dodson, between explaining heaven and the history of the West, tries to help her with the answers. He is a world-class know-it-all, quoting Plato and Emerson and Oscar Wilde as often as he sets up his daughter's fly rod. That said, he's also a long-time journalist, and his clear, nimble prose keeps this travel story humming along: "Old Blue cooled down and Amos hung his big head out the window to let the rushing wind flap his jowls," writes Dodson of one evening's drive. "Maggie sang along with Trisha Yearwood, a lovely torch song about somebody aching to hit the road after a love affair gone wrong, anxious to get out from under a rain cloud and find a way to live again ... the sound of my fishergirl's sweet voice made my anxiety begin to lift like Portland fog." <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Praise for <i>Faithful Travelers:</i><p>"James Dodson's <i>Faithful Travelers</i> is a journey of self-discovery...A brilliantly written book by one of America's most gifted writers."<br>--Terry Kay, author of <i>The Runaway</i></p><p>"James Dodson has written what every woman who loves her father has been waiting for, and what every father who loves his little girl needs: the perfect daddy-daughter love story."<br> --Jessica Maxwell, author of <i>I Don't Know Why I Swallowed the Fly</i></p><p>"<i>Faithful Travelers</i> is a fly-fishing journey made immensely memorable by its wise and vibrant sojourners."<br> --Nick Lyons, author of <i>A Flyfisher's World</i></p><p>Praise for <i>Final Rounds:</i></p><p>"A beautiful, deeply moving tribute to the love between father and son."<br>--Michael Murphy, author of <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i></p><p>"I have never liked golf or understood the people who play it.

Blankenship's study of Christianity in the infamous camps where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II yields insights both far-reaching and timely. While most Japanese Americans maintained their traditional identities as Buddhists, a sizeable minority identified as Christian, and a number of church leaders sought to minister to them in the camps. Blankenship shows how church leaders were forced to assess the ethics and pragmatism of fighting against or acquiescing to what they clearly perceived, even in the midst of a national crisis, as an unjust social system. These religious activists became acutely aware of the impact of government, as well as church, policies that targeted ordinary Americans of diverse ethnicities.<br><br>Going through the doors of the camp churches and delving deeply into the religious experiences of the incarcerated and the faithful who aided them, Blankenship argues that the incarceration period introduced new social and legal approaches for Christians of all stripes to challenge the constitutionality of government policies on race and civil rights. She also shows how the camp experience nourished the roots of an Asian American liberation theology that sprouted in the sixties and seventies.<br><br></p><p>Anne M. Blankenship is assistant professor of American religious history at North Dakota State University.[Blankenship] deftly demonstrates the complexities of white Christian programs and Nikkei religious practice and the importance of spiritual life to the incarceration story.--<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i><br>Will likely spark productive classroom discussions about the complex layers of power, agency, struggle, and meaning in the religious experiences and ideologies of the incarcerated, the incarcerators, and bystanders.--<i>Reading Religion</i><br>Opens up [the story of how some American church people ministered to&nbsp;Japanese Americans in the&nbsp;camps]&nbsp;with skill, deep research, and compelling storytelling and analysis. It's certain to become the definitive work on the subject. And it compels thought on how to respond to the current hysteria around other immigrant groups perceived to be disloyal.--<i>The Christian Century</i><br>Succeeds as both cultural and religious history by providing a compelling discussion of the government's attempt to uphold religious freedoms while simultaneously attempting to justify its suspension of civil liberties in the name of national security.--<i>American Historical Review</i><br>This important work argues convincingly that to understand Japanese incarceration, it is essential to incorporate the role of protest movements within the U.S. religious community.

Cowman long ago discovered a fountain that sustained her, and she shared it with the world, Streams in the Desert -- her collection of prayerful meditations, Christian writings, and God&#39;s written promises--has become one of the most dearly loved, best-selling devotionals of all time since its first publication in 1925. Filled with insight into the richness of God&#39;s provision and the purpose of His plan, this enduring classic has encouraged and inspired generations of Christians. I heard the flow of hidden springs; before me palms rose green and fair; The birds were singing; all the air was filled and stirred with angels&#39; wings. Now James Reimann, editor of the highly acclaimed updated edition of My Utmost for His Highest by Oswald Chambers, again brings us the wisdom of the past in the language of today, by introducing this updated edition of Streams in the Desert. With fresh, contemporary wording and precise NIV text, the timeless message of the original flows unhindered through these pages, lending guidance and hope to a new generation of believers. We never know where God has hidden His streams. We see a large stone and have no idea that it covers the source of a spring. We see a rocky areas and never imagine that it is hiding a fountain. God leads me into hard and difficult places, and it is there I realize I am where eternal streams abide. Day by day, Streams in the Desert will lead you from life&#39;s dry desolate places to the waters of the River of Life -- and beyond, to their very Source.</p><p>The late Mrs. Charles E. Cowman wrote the beloved, classic devotional Streams in the Desert. She served with her husband in Japan as a missionary until his illness forced the couple to return to the United StatesStreams in the Desert is a powerful collection of meditations, Christian writings, and Scripture, and remains one of the most beloved devotionals of all time. This updated edition, however, offers even more, including Scripture, Subject, and Contributors Indexes. Author L. B. Cowman thoughtfully and prayerfully chose the Scripture and penned or selected the meditations she knew would provide a river of wisdom, encouragement, and inspiration to weary desert travelers. Those words are still clearly relevant in today&#39;s world, where people thirst more than ever for reassurance and guidance. In this updated edition, however, editor Jim Reimann lovingly combines contemporary wording and precise NIV text to help introduce a whole new generation of believers to the timeless messages of God&#39;s faithfulness. Easy-to-read yet true to the essence of the original, this Streams in the Desert offers a refreshing daily dip into God&#39;s purpose, plan, and enduring promise. And now this classic content takes on a classic look. The deluxe edition is bound in stunning Italian Duo-Tone---the perfect accent for the beautiful and ageless messages of hope found inside.</p><h2>Park and Recreation Structures</h2><p>America's parks-and their architectural companion, the log cabin-hold a powerful grip on our imagination. Harkening back to a simpler time, these rustic structures serve as a reminder of America's frontier spirit, and serve as a popular source of inspiration for contemporary architecture, in everything from simple vacation homes to the mansion "lodges" favored by today's wealthy elites. This classic three-volume survey, first published in 1938 by the National Park Service, details in photographs and measured drawings the rich legacy of America's park structures. In over 500 illustrations, <i>Park and Recreation Structures</i> documents picnic tables, dams, drinking fountains, trail signs, storage sheds, bridges, boathouses, lodges, and inns from the glory days of park construction. Reproduced in its entirety in a single volume, this book will serve as a source of ideas, details, and imagery for architects, landscapists, gardeners, and anyone interested in America's national parks.</p><p>Albert H. Good was the architectural consultant to the National Park Service at the time Park and Recreation Structures was originally published.This gorgeously reproduced volume, a reprint of the classic 1938 National Park Service study, offers inspiration through hundreds of drawings and photos of park structures. <strong><i>Landscape Architecture</i></strong><br><br></p><h2>Alchemy&#x2015;The Great Work: A History and Evaluation of the Western Hermetic Tradition (Mind, Body, Knowledge)</h2><p><p>Alchemy is the art of transformation. At its simplest, the alchemist turns base metals into gold. However, this is only one dimension of alchemy--at a more sophisticated level the alchemist's "base metal" is symbolic of himself that needs to be worked upon and the "gold" produced is the alchemist himself in his or her quest to perfect his own nature. In short, true alchemy is a discipline involving physical, psychological and spiritual work aimed at producing wholeness and enlightenment.</p><p>From the origins of alchemy, both reputed and documented, Cherry Gilchrist's lively and sympathetic narrative takes the reader from the alchemical interests of the ancient Egyptians to the flowering of alchemy in the 17th century. She also elucidates the complexities of alchemical symbolism and examines the ways in which alchemy has developed in the 20th century.</p></p><p><b>Cherry Gilchrist</b> has studied meditation, Tarot and Kabbalah since her early twenties. She has also been a lifelong member of the Nine Ladies association, concerned with renewing feminine spirituality. After gaining an MA from the University of Cambridge, Cherry has worked primarily as a writer, but also in a variety of roles, such as childbirth teacher, early music singer, lecturer, family historian, and owner of an arts and crafts gallery. As an author, and lifelong participant in the Western wisdom tradition, she has written definitive books on alchemy, Russian mythology, and divination. She lives in Devon, UK, with artist husband Robert Lee-Wade. Visit her at www.cherrygilchrist.co.uk."This is a history and evaluation of the Western Hermetic Tradition and a concise history of the philosophy and practice of alchemy from its beginnings to the 20th century.

The tourists are still asleep. Freelance and part-time crime photographer Alex Rutledge bicycles near-vacant streets, taking pictures for his own enjoyment. But he's challenged at a restoration district construction site, accused by a developer of snapping photos for an expose. <br><br>An hour later, the city police request Rutledge's forensic photo expertise. A murder victim has been found - at the same work site. Detective Dexter Hayes, Jr., is caustic and inept, and Rutledge is dismissed before he completes his work. An hour later, the county sheriff, Chicken Neck Liska, asks Alex to photograph another murder victim, this time on nearby Stock Island. <br><br>Rutledge soon suspects that the murders are linked - illogically, through him. He can't divulge the link to his lover, Teresa Barga, for fear of compromising her police media liaison job. Alex questions the detective's blundering, while the cops begin to link him to the crimes. A powerful real estate broker offers Rutledge an odd, lucrative job. Friends are threatened. He and Teresa dodge gunshots. Yet there is no identifiable antagonist, no motive, no reason for Rutledge to be a hub for evil. To protect himself and his friends, to avoid arrest - unsuccessfully, at first - he must scratch for information on an island where few tell the truth. <br><br>At the core of <i>Bone Island Mambo</i> is betrayal, retribution, and revenge. The plot twists in surprising directions, and Corcoran's characters are true characters, never as laid-back as they first appear. Visit Key West, and hang on for dear life. <br></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, May 2001:</b> This is Tom Corcoran's third Alex Rutledge mystery, in a series set in the Key West tourists rarely see. Rutledge, a forensic photographer, lives among the eccentrics who make Key West their year-round home. He has made his share of enemies on the island and has romanced many of the women, so there is a feeling of family about this series--with all the dysfunction that word can imply.<p> Rutledge is photographing a construction project when he is approached by two women, both of whom have ties to the construction project (and apparently to everything else of importance in Key West). Within minutes Rutledge is set upon by two young men who definitely mean him harm. He fights them off. Within hours, Rutledge is called out to photograph two murders--a man dressed in women's clothes and a headless corpse lying on a bench. Rutledge finds himself trying to make sense of the two murders and how they are connected with the attack on him, while also butting heads with some important locals, including Butler Dunwoody, a project developer new to town.</p><p> Rutledge can't help feeling suspicious of Dexter Hayes, the watch commander who calls him to photograph the first body. The son of a disgraced cop, Hayes makes no effort to keep the integrity of the crime scene intact and dismisses Rutledge from the scene soon after he starts photographing. Then ex-sheriff Tommy Tucker, another disgraced officer, asks Rutledge to meet with Mercer Holloway, a more entrenched island property developer.</p><p> Soon Rutledge is up to his neck in murder and intrigue, and the worst part is trying to tell the good guys from the bad. Corcoran writes in a concise and breezy style, and Alex Rutledge should be attracting more fans to his laid-back lifestyle, which always includes a murder or two. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Tom Corcoran has been a bartender, disc jockey, screenwriter, Navy officer and journalist.

Sentimental it is, but not so as to undermine the picture of a time when a life of landed gentry, squalid poverty and routine village intimacy co-existed within a familiar seasonal routine. </p><p>John Moore (1907-1967) was a British author and pioneer conservationist.

Thomas went to Vietnam at the age of eighteen, where he served as a crew chief on assault helicopters. By the end of his tour, he had been awarded numerous medals, including the Purple Heart. He had also killed many people, witnessed horrifying cruelty, and narrowly escaped death on a number of occasions. <br><br>When Thomas returned home he found that he continued to live in a state of war. He was overwhelmed by feelings of guilt, fear, anger, and despair, all of which were intensified by the rejection he experienced as a Vietnam veteran. For years, Thomas struggled with post-traumatic stress, drug and alcohol addiction, isolation, and even homelessness. <br><br>A turning point came when he attended a meditation retreat for Vietnam veterans led by the renowned Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh. Here he encountered the Buddhist teachings on meditation and mindfulness, which helped him to stop running from his past and instead confront the pain of his war experiences directly and compassionately. Thomas was eventually ordained as a Zen monk and teacher, and he began making pilgrimages to promote peace and nonviolence in war-scarred places around the world including Bosnia, Auschwitz, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and the Middle East. <br><br> <i>At Hell's Gate </i> is Thomas's dramatic coming-of-age story and a spiritual travelogue from the horrors of combat to discovering a spiritual approach to healing violence and ending war from the inside out. In simple and direct language, Thomas shares timeless teachings on healing emotional suffering and offers us practical guidance in using mindfulness and compassion to transform our lives.</p><p>Claude Anshin Thomas went to Vietnam at the age of eighteen, where he received numerous awards and decorations, including twenty-seven Air Medals, a Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Purple Heart. Today he is a monk in the Soto Zen tradition and an active speaker and Zen teacher in the United States and Europe. He is also the founder of the Zaltho Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes peace and nonviolence (www.zaltho.org). This is his first book."Written with relentless courage and utter compassion, this account of violence and transformation is one of the most amazing and wonderful stories I've ever read."&#x2014;Michael Herr, author of <i>Dispatches</i> <br><br>"This is a book of great power. Thomas's pilgrimage to find living peace in a world full of terror and war gives us a wonderfully practical lesson in how to lift ourselves out of the insanity of fear, hatred, violence, and trauma. His singularly courageous story has the power to heal, to inspire, to teach."&#x2014;John Laurence, former CBS News correspondent and author of <i>The Cat from Hue: A Vietnam War Story </i> <br><br>"A powerful, wise, and genuinely profound spiritual odyssey from the insanity of violence (in the world, within ourselves, and in the assumptions of American culture) to the peace and compassion of mindfulness practice. Thomas beautifully models Zen teachings in his daily life, and by doing so he enlightens and liberates us all."&#x2014;Charles Johnson, winner of the National Book Award for <i>Middle Passage </i> <br><br>"Claude Anshin Thomas has been an inspiration to me. Our world urgently needs to listen to him tell of his life in war and then in peace."&#x2014;Maxine Hong Kingston, author of <i>The Woman Warrior </i> <br><br>"Thomas's journey from the killing fields of Vietnam to the path of peace and pilgrimage testifies to his&#x2014;and our&#x2014;powerful urge to awaken. At the same time, this is not a pretty story. Anshin Thomas has lived in hell, knows its smell and taste, and continues to confront it every day of his life.

How else could I account for the fact that years ago, right after the accident -- when the smoke cleared and the car had stopped tumbling end over end to rest upside down in a ditch -- I was still alive; I could hear Elizabeth, my little girl, crying? The police officer who had pulled me out of the car rode with me to the hospital to have my broken leg set, with Elizabeth -- completely unhurt, a miracle -- sitting on his lap the whole time. He'd held my hand when I was taken to identify my husband Jack's body. He came to the funeral. He showed up at my door to personally inform me when the drunk driver who ran us off the road was arrested. </p><p> The policeman's name was Kurt Nealon. Long after the trial and the conviction, he kept coming around just to make sure that Elizabeth and I were all right. He brought toys for her birthday and Christmas. He fixed the clogged drain in the upstairs bathroom. He came over after he was off duty to mow the savannah that had once been our lawn. </p><p> I had married Jack because he was the love of my life; I had planned to be with him forever. But that was before the definition of forever was changed by a man with a blood alcohol level of .22. </p><p> I was surprised that Kurt seemed to understand that you might never love someone as hard as you had the first time you'd fallen; I was even more surprised to learn that maybe you <i>could</i>. </p><p> Five years later, when Kurt and I found out we were going to have a baby, I almost regretted it -- the same way you stand beneath a perfect blue sky on the most glorious day of the summer and admit to yourself that all moments from here on in couldn't possibly measure up. Elizabeth had been two when Jack died; Kurt was the only father she'd ever known. They had a connection so special it sometimes made me feel I should turn away, that I was intruding. If Elizabeth was the princess, then Kurt was her knight. </p><p> The imminent arrival of this little sister (how strange is it that none of us ever imagined the new baby could be anything but a girl?) energized Kurt and Elizabeth to fever pitch. Elizabeth drew elaborate sketches of what the baby's room should look like. Kurt hired a contractor to build the addition. But then the builder's mother had a stroke and he had to move unexpectedly to Florida; none of the other crews had time to fit our job into their schedules before the baby's birth. We had a hole in our wall and rain leaking through the attic ceiling; mildew grew on the soles of our shoes. </p><p> When I was seven months pregnant, I came downstairs to find Elizabeth playing in a pile of leaves that had blown past the plastic sheeting into the living room. I was deciding between crying and raking my carpet when the doorbell rang. </p><p> He was holding a canvas roll that contained his tools, something that never left his possession, like another man might tote around his wallet. His hair brushed his shoulders and was knotted. His clothes were filthy and he smelled of snow -- although it wasn't the right season. Shay Bourne arrived, unexpected, like a flyer from a summer carnival that blusters in on a winter wind, making you wonder just where it's been hiding all this time. </p><p> He had trouble speaking -- the words tangled, and he had to stop and unravel them before he could say what he needed to say. "I want to..." he began, and then started over: "Do you, is there, because..." The effort made a fine sweat break out on his forehead. "Is there anything I can do?" he finally managed, as Elizabeth came running toward the front door. </p><p> <i>You can leave</i>, I thought. I started to close the door, instinctively protecting my daughter. "I don't think so..." </p><p> Elizabeth slipped her hand into mine and blinked up at him. "There's a lot that needs to be fixed," she said. </p><p> He got down to his knees then and spoke to my daughter easily -- words that had been full of angles and edges for him a minute before now flowed like a waterfall. "I can help," he replied. </p><p> Kurt was always saying people are never who you think they are, that it was necessary to get a complete background check on a person before you made any promises. I'd tell him he was being too suspicious, too much the cop. After all, I had let Kurt himself into my life simply because he had kind eyes and a good heart, and even he couldn't argue with the results. </p><p> "What's your name?" I asked. </p><p> "Shay. Shay Bourne." </p><p> "You're hired, Mr. Bourne," I said, the beginning of the end. <b></b></p><p><b> SEVEN MONTHS LATER </b> </p><p> <b>Michael</b> </p><p> Shay Bourne was nothing like I expected. </p><p> I had prepared myself for a hulking brute of a man, one with hammy fists and no neck and eyes narrowed into slits. This was, after all, the crime of the century -- a double murder that had captured the attention of people from Nashua to Dixville Notch; a crime that seemed all the worse because of its victims: a little girl, and a police officer who happened to be her stepfather. It was the kind of crime that made you wonder if you were safe in your own house, if the people you trusted could turn on you at any moment -- and maybe because of this, New Hampshire prosecutors sought the death penalty for the first time in fifty-eight years. </p><p> Given the media blitz, there was talk of whether twelve jurors who hadn't formed a reaction to this crime could even be found, but they managed to locate us. They unearthed me in a study carrel at UNH, where I was writing a senior honors thesis in mathematics. I hadn't had a decent meal in a month, much less read a newspaper -- and so I was the perfect candidate for Shay Bourne's capital murder case. </p><p> The first time we filed out of our holding pen -- a small room in the superior courthouse that would begin to feel as familiar as my apartment -- I thought maybe some bailiff had let us into the wrong courtroom. This defendant was small and delicately proportioned -- the kind of guy who grew up being the punch line to high school jokes. He wore a tweed jacket that swallowed him whole, and the knot of his necktie squared away from him at the perpendicular, as if it were being magnetically repelled. His cuffed hands curled in his lap like small animals; his hair was shaved nearly to the skull. He stared down at his lap, even when the judge spoke his name and it hissed through the room like steam from a radiator. </p><p> The judge and the lawyers were taking care of housekeeping details when the fly came in. I noticed this for two reasons: in March, you don't see many flies in New Hampshire, and I wondered how you went about swatting one away from you when you were handcuffed and chained at the waist. Shay Bourne stared at the insect when it paused on the legal pad in front of him, and then in a jangle of metal, he raised his bound hands and crashed them down on the table to kill it. </p><p> Or so I thought, until he turned his palms upward, his fingers opened one petal at a time, and the insect went zipping off to bother someone else. </p><p> In that instant, he glanced at me, and I realized two things: </p><p> 1. He was terrified.<br> 2. He was approximately the same age that I was.<br> </p><p> This double murderer, this monster, looked like the water polo team captain who had sat next to me in an economics seminar last semester. He resembled the deliveryman from the pizza place that had a thin crust, the kind I liked. He even reminded me of the boy I'd seen walking in the snow on my way to court, the one I'd rolled down my window for and asked if he wanted a ride. In other words, he didn't look the way I figured a killer would look, if I ever ran across one. He could have been any other kid in his twenties. He could have been me. </p><p> Except for the fact that he was ten feet away, chained at the wrists and ankles. And it was my job to decide whether or not he deserved to live. <b></b></p><p><b> * * * </b> </p><p> A month later, I could tell you that serving on a jury is nothing like you see on TV. There was a lot of being paraded back and forth between the courtroom and the jury room; there was bad food from a local deli for lunch; there were lawyers who liked to hear themselves talk, and trust me, the DAs were never as hot as the girl on <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU</i>. Even after four weeks, coming into this courtroom felt like landing in a foreign country without a guidebook...and yet, I couldn't plead ignorant just because I was a tourist. I was expected to speak the language fluently. </p><p> Part one of the trial was finished: we had convicted Bourne. The prosecution presented a mountain of evidence proving Kurt Nealon had been shot in the line of duty, attempting to arrest Shay Bourne after he'd found him with his stepdaughter, her underwear in Bourne's pocket. June Nealon had come home from her OB appointment to find her husband and daughter dead. The feeble argument offered up by the defense -- that Kurt had misunderstood a verbally paralyzed Bourne; that the gun had gone off by accident -- didn't hold a candle to the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. Even worse, Bourne never took the stand on his own behalf -- which could have been because of his poor language skills...or because he was not only guilty as sin but such a wild card that his own attorneys didn't trust him. </p><p> We were now nearly finished with part two of the trial -- the sentencing phase -- or in other words, the part that separated this trial from every other criminal murder trial for the past half century in New Hampshire. Now that we knew Bourne had committed the crime, did he deserve the death penalty? </p><p> This part was a little like a <i>Reader's Digest</i> condensed version of the first one. The prosecution gave a recap of evidence presented during the criminal trial; and then the defense got a chance to garner sympathy for a murderer. We learned that Bourne had been bounced around the foster care system. That when he was sixteen, he set a fire in his foster home and spent two years in a juvenile detention facility. He had untreated bipolar disorder, central aud...</p></p><h2>Rehnquist: A Personal Portrait of the Distinguished Chief Justice of the United States</h2><p><i>"This book is a final act of posthumous loyalty. Without it, history will have an incomplete -- and I believe unbalanced -- picture of the remarkable man who was the sixteenth chief justice of the United States, a man I was proud to call my friend."</i> <p> <b>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½</b> </p><p> </p><p> The impact of Chief Justice William Rehnquist -- who served as a Supreme Court justice for a third of a century and headed the federal judiciary under four presidents -- cannot be overstated. His dissenting opinion in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> and his strongly stated positions on issues as various as freedom of the press, school prayer, and civil rights, would guarantee his memory on their own. Chiefly, though, William Rehnquist will always be remembered for his highly visible role in two of the most important and contentious political events of recent American history: the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999 and the Supreme Court's decision that made George W. Bush the victor in the presidential election of 2000. </p><p> </p><p> Despite his importance as a public figure, however, William Rehnquist scrupulously preserved his private life. And while his judicial opinions often inflamed passions and aroused both ire and praise, they were rarely personal. The underlying quirks, foibles, and eccentricities of the man were always under wraps. </p><p> </p><p> Now, however, journalist Herman J. Obermayer has broken that silence in a memoir of their nineteen-year friendship that is both factually detailed and intensely moving, his own personal tribute to his dearest friend. In these pages, we meet for the first time William Rehnquist the man, in a portrait that can only serve to enhance the legacy of a Chief Justice who will be remembered in history as being among America's most influential. </p><p></p></p><p>Ï»ï¿½ <b>one</b> <br> <b>TENNIS AND LITERATURE</b> <br> <br> <b>i.</b> <br> <p> <b>It is unlikely</b> Bill and I would ever have met if a mutual acquaintance had not invited us to join a doubles tennis game he was organizing. If the players had not been terribly mismatched, we would not have become fast friends. </p><p> Ken Haggerty, a neighborhood dentist and a local Republican politician, invited Bill and me to join a "dream" tennis game he was organizing in the autumn of 1986. Since all of the players led active lives the "dream game" had five players, including a rotating substitute. The other players were Linwood Holton, the first Republican governor of Virginia since Reconstruction, and John (Dick) Hickey, the local Catholic bishop. We shared the same criteria: We were all political conservatives over fifty-Â­five. We lived near one another in Northern Virginia and were members of the Washington Golf and Country Club. Plus, none of us had a regular weekend game. It all sounded like fun. </p><p> Haggerty had organized the game like a hostess planning a dinner party. A hostess assumes that if her guests share similar worldviews, the conversation will be lively and possibly stimulating. If their political perspectives are similar, there will be none of the bitter, nasty arguments that so often ruin social events in suburban Washington. </p><p> But athletic contests are not dinner parties. Tennis especially is fun only when the players are athletically well matched. Its demand for relatively equal skills is uncompromising. Conversation is incidental. Contestants usually know nothing about each Â­other's politics or philosophical musings. Onï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2018;court chatter is usually considered intrusive. Most players resent it. </p><p> After a few weeks it became clear that the "dream game" was hopelessly dysfunctional. Haggerty's notion on how to organize a weekly tennis game was totally wrong: even though our political and philosophical outlooks were similar, our tennis skills were not even close. Haggerty was a former all-American basketball player who had captained the Holy Cross College team that included NBA Hall of Famer Bob Cousy. None of the others could run around a backcourt half as fast as he could. Linwood Holton and I were never part of a sports Â­team's starting lineup, not even at summer camp. Bill was a slightly better athlete than I was, but after high school his only competitive sports activity was social tennis. The Catholic bishop was a good athlete, but he knew so little about the game he had trouble keeping score. To compensate for an obviously awkward arrangement, Holton, always the politician, told jokes after bad points, particularly ones that were attributable to his own ineptitude. </p><p> Bill and I shared our disappointment with the way the game was evolving. We got up early on Sunday mornings to play tennis, not to listen to bad jokes. Haggerty and the bishop pretended they were having great fun; I found their upbeat chatter embarrassing. Nobody was having a good time. </p><p> While the "dream game" was becoming something of a weekly ordeal, Bill and I recognized that our athletic skills were similar. Further, we both felt that talk on the court should be limited to occasionally acknowledging a good shot by your opponent and, only when necessary, stating the score. One weekend, when Haggerty could not find four "dream game" members willing to rise early and participate in a game that was no fun, Bill and I decided to play singles together. We ended up having a good time. And for more than a dozen years, we continued to play singles every Sunday when we were both in town. </p><p> Bill, who played doubles weekly with his twentysomething law clerks, was a better doubles player than I was. The long reach that went along with the six-Â­foot-Â­two-Â­inch frame made him formidable at the net. On the other hand, since I preferred playing singles, I could run around the backcourt better than he could. Neither of us had strong serves. Although both of our forehands were stronger than our backhands, neither of us scored points because of our forehands' overwhelming speed. </p><p> Although we were both in our sixties, we were in good enough shape that an hour of hard-fought tennis singles was exhilarating rather than exhausting. We were not serious athletes, but we were serious players. Once we decided who served first, there was no chitchat or trips to the water cooler. Our competitive natures precluded approaching a Sunday tennis game as casual exercise. </p><p> After we began playing singles together, we never again played in a "dream game." Although Justices Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens (both of whom were better players than we were) often played singles with nonjudicial friends at Washington Golf and Country Club at the same time, they never invited us to join their game, and vice versa. </p><p> We did, however, play mixed doubles a few times each year when Bill's daughter Nancy, who lived in Middlebury, Vermont, and his sister Jean Laurin, who lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, came to visit. At least one mixed-doubles match with my wife, Betty Nan, and me was usually part of Â­Bill's entertainment program for both. Jean played at about the same level as Betty Nan, and Nancy was younger and a better athlete. All three women were better tennis players than their male partners. Our matches were spirited and fun. Neither family won consistently. </p><p> Probably the most memorable match with Jean and Bill began at 7:00 a.m. on the day after Nan Rehnquist's funeral. When Bill suggested the game, I questioned whether he wanted to be seen at a country club less than twenty-four hours after his Â­wife's funeral. But he brushed my inquiry aside. Two hours of vigorous exercise with his sister as his partner was as good a way as any to begin the next chapter in his life. <br> <br> </p> <b>ii.</b> <br> <p> <b>Washington Golf and</b> Country Club is a unique institution. Founded in 1894, it is Washington's oldest golf club and has listed on its membership roster Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson and Harding; the latter three were avid golfers who played the course regularly. Presidents Taft and Harding occasionally participated in club tournaments. Although there were no restrictions in its bylaws, blacks and Jews were not granted membership until the mid-1970s (I joined in 1978 and Bill in 1985). </p><p> Part of a country club's appeal is that within its confines the hierarchical distinctions that are part of everyday life in government and business are supposed to disappear. But country club ambience cannot always trump the real-world distinctions that exist outside its gates. </p><p> If, while waiting for our court or chatting after a match, another member stopped by, Bill usually jumped up, extended his hand and said, "Hi, I'm Bill Rehnquist." I always introduced him the same way. But only one in ten responded, "Hi, Bill." I estimate the remainder was evenly split: half continued the conversation without addressing him by name and the other half responded, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chief Justice." </p><p> Still, I know of no activity in Washington in which rank and status mean less than in the contest for who gets to use Washington Golf's five indoor tennis courts on a midÂ­winter Sunday morning. Court times are allocated on the basis of stringently enforced rules. Sunday between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. is the preferred time to play tennis (before church and football). Often as many as fifty players vie for court times. </p><p> The tennis clerk begins accepting calls at 8:00 a.m. Saturday for Sunday court times. After 8:00:01 the tennis reservations telephone line is constantly busy. If a member does not slip through between busy signals until after 8:04 or 8:05, he or she probably missed the cut for the most desirable times. There are no exceptions. Everybody is on equal ground -- even the chief justice of the United States and his fellow justices, who are often battling for the same time slot. In addition to me and Bill, Justices Stevens and Scalia, the president of the club, highly paid CEOs and prominent local citizens competed against twentysomethings who were skilled speed dialers. When two justices see each other on the court early Sunday morning, they likely jest, "Where did you learn speed dialing?" or "I was told nobody gets special treatment at this club." If we were both in town and we missed our regular Sunday morning game, it was almost always attributable to our getting beaten by overwhelmed phone lines. <br> <br> </p> <b>iii.</b> <br> <p> <b>For many months,</b> Bill's and my weekly tennis games were enjoyable, vigorous athletic contests. But little more. After our Sunday morning game, we usually relaxed and chatted for fifteen or twenty minutes. In the beginning we talked the universal language of small talk: sports, the weather and political trivia. It was enjoyable albeit superficial. </p><p> Then we began exploring what, if anything, we shared beyond evenly matched court skills. We were curious about each other. We were also reticent. Neither of us felt compelled to advance our relationship. Our pace was deliberate and hesitant. The most important element in our friendship, shared core values and intellectual interests, did not become apparent until after we had known each other on the tennis court for many months. </p><p> Then a period of obtuse inquiry began. It was reciprocal and unstructured. We knew that we shared certain core values. We wanted to know more about each other. But our objective was subtle, unstated. <br> <br> </p> <b>iv.</b> <br> <p> <b>One Sunday in</b> 1987, for no apparent reason, we began talking about the books that we were currently reading. For many years, discussion of our recreational reading became part of our routine. It continued long after we stopped playing tennis together. </p><p> When I visited Bil...</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Dennis Drabelle Drawing on his long friendship with William Rehnquist (1924-2005), editor and publisher Herman Obermayer has written a personal memoir of the nation's 16th chief justice. Rehnquist could seem forbidding (cutting off attorneys arguing before the Supreme Court in midsentence when their allotted time was up) and a bit of a stuffed robe (he designed and wore a special version of the judicial garment, with gold arm stripes). But in a vignette recounted by Obermayer, Rehnquist sounds like a pretty good guy to pop a brew and watch a football game with. This is just what he and Obermayer were doing when the subject of TV coverage of arguments before the court came up. " 'Instant replay' would make Supreme Court viewing hugely popular," Obermayer writes of their fantasizing, "and several justices would become folk heroes and superstars. The justices . . . would change the oral argument format so that at the end of each half hour of oral argument, there would be a fifteen-minute break so the Court's John Madden would have time for a chalkboard analysis of the attorney's argument and the justices' queries." Not surprisingly in the light of riffs such as those, the Rehnquist court defended itself against TV coverage, and so far the Roberts court has held the line, too. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

The ancestors of Canada&#x2019;s Aboriginal peoples crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia to North America. Moving steadily south and east, over the course of hundreds of generations, the descedants of this original group of explorers won for themselves a continent. In the path of their migration, up and down the face of North and South America, they created a quilt-work of civilizations, each with its own history and values. Over the millennia these nations rose, fell, and evolved in concert with the larger rhythms of nature.<br><br>Flash forward to the early 1500s when our conventional narrative gathers steam. Along the eastern shore of North America the first European explorers make their landfalls and experience the &#x2018;first contact&#x2019; that gave Canada its name. The arc of history moves through the early wars of conquest to the establishment of the first permanent European settlements in the 16th and 17th centuries. To Canadians, the signposts in this historical journey are a series of familiar dates strung out in succession: Jacques Cartier landing at Chaleur Bay in 1534, Champlain&#x2019;s voyage up the St. Lawrence in 1603, and the creation of the Hudson Bay Company in 1670.<br><br>Having witnessed the European migration to their land, Aboriginal peoples are moved figuratively to the sidelines of history. The standard history of Canada from the 17th century onward is the story of European colonial wars, the introduction and impact of Western technology and industry, and the deepening of a North American political culture based on the ideas of the Enlightenment. Increasingly strangers in their own lands, Aboriginal peoples come to be perceived, more and more, as an administrative challenge as opposed to a dynamic force in the unfolding of the country&#x2019;s identity. The combined effects of the treaty and reserve systems, the failed Rebellions of 1885 and subsequent Indian Acts all conspire to render Canada&#x2019;s Aboriginal peoples an historical anachronism in the eyes of the dominant culture. This sentiment, in various forms, has continued up to the present-day despite a decades-long revival of Aboriginal culture, industry, and government.<br><br>Even this most cursory look at the traditional narrative of the history of Aboriginal peoples confirms that we read their story through our systems of understanding. It is difficult, if not impossible, for one culture to capture the historical reality of another culture that it has displaced. As hard as non-Aboriginals might try to correct for biases, our history and traditions are different. European culture sees the passage of time as a chronology of events as opposed to cycle of being and becoming. It embraces scientific criteria to determine what is an historical fact and looks askance at myth and oral history. And ultimately, it stresses the very process of historical inquiry as a hallmark of civilization. All of these attitudes not only set Western culture apart from an Aboriginal world view, they determine the very way history is recorded, created, and conveyed to future generations.<br><br>This is not to say that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures are incapable of creating common understandings and mutual respect. What we need to work on is finding new ways &#x2013; after more than four hundred years of living together &#x2013; to hear each others&#x2019; stories anew, to step out of preconceived notions of not only what constitutes our history but how our history is constituted. <i>Our Story </i>is an important contribution to moving dialogue in this direction.<br><br>The nine works of fiction contained in this volume tell the story of Aboriginal peoples in Canada not as a string of facts laid bare in chronological order. Instead, each of the Aboriginal authors has chosen an historical event and through the act of storytelling, turned it into a work of fiction. In each of these fictionalized accounts we are exposed to the Aboriginal sense of place, the passage of time, and the complex relationship of myth and truth. The result is a new vantage point not just on how Aboriginals perceive their place in Canadian history but a different approach to recounting the past and making it come alive in the present.<br><br>As a fusion of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal notions of storytelling and history, <b>Our Story</b> contains, at its heart, the basis for the two cultures not only to better understand and appreciate each other, but also to move forward together.<br><br><i>Rudyard Griffiths</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Bessie Pease Gutmann: Her Life and Works</h2><p>Chronicles the life of the artist whose style of art fell out of favor in the 1930s, and includes 170 reproductions of her postcard art, calendar art, fine art prints, and advertising art which brought her fame throughout the world</p><p></p><h2>The Coming Global Superstorm</h2><p><b>THE EXTRAORDINARY <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER. <br>A DIRE WARNING FOR OUR FUTURE.</b> <br> <br> <b>The climatological nightmare portrayed in the motion picture <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i> isn't just a fantasy scenario.</b><br> The first decade of the 21st century has seen some of the most violent weather on record, from devastating tsunamis to killer hurricanes.

Paranormal superstars Art Bell and Whitley Strieber bring environmentalism to the masses tabloid-style in <i>The Coming Global Superstorm</i>, a quick look at global warming and its potentially catastrophic effects. Like Old Testament prophets, Bell and Strieber embrace lovingly detailed depictions of global cataclysm; unlike them, our modern-day doomsayers have more to go on than that old-time religion. Their writing is clear and straightforward, interspersing hard data with dramatization and speculation to create an engaging, enjoyable, but thoroughly spooky warning of the next Ice Age.<p> Scoffers would do well to remember the 1900 hurricane that devastated Galveston, Texas, despite the clear warnings--we may have advanced our meteorological knowledge over the 20th century, but is our judgment any better? Bell and Strieber are ultimately optimistic that quick behavior change can avert the big storm for a while, even if archaeological evidence suggests its inevitability. Their solutions range from the small scale (buy fuel-efficient cars) to the grandiose (global cooperation in weather monitoring). Whether their suggestions will help is a moot question (how could we ever know?); surely, though, they won't hurt. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Art Bell</b> is America's voice in the night, heard weekends by more than fifteen million people on the show he created, <i>Coast-to- Coast AM</i>.

Through around 300 works, documents, and original drawings from private collections and museums from all over the world, this important volume reconstructs the work and life of Carlo Scarpa from the very beginnings of his career when he worked as artistic director for the Venini glassworks, between 1932 and 1947. The experience acquired in those years offered Scarpa the possibility of following the experimental vocation that was to also distinguish his work as an architect, and to carry forward research intended to investigate the expressive possibilities of glass the material, to experiment with the age-old crafting techniques of the old masters of Murano and to update the traditional forms of craftsmanship in glass. It is no coincidence that Scarpa&#x2019;s glasswork can be organized into no less than thirty distinct styles, differentiated by the technique of execution and the glass construction method used. We need only think of the corrosi (corroded), in which the material is attacked and eaten into by sawdust soaked in hydrofluoric acid. Under Scarpa&#x2019;s artistic direction the forms created at the Venini glassworks are more sober and modern, with geometrical inspiration, and above all, the importance of the role of the designer is established in the history of 20th-century Venetian glass, which owes much of its substantial renewal to him.</p><p><p>Marino Barovier is an author and independent curator. He was born in Venice into one of the oldest families of Murano glassmakers. In 1983, he joined his wife, Marina, in the study of the history of twentieth-century Murano glass.</p></p><h2>Teacher and Child: A Book for Parents and Teachers</h2><p>Teacher and Child: A Book for Parents and Teachers [mass_market] Haim G.

Lately she&#x2019;d been thinking about moving back to Massachusetts, or somewhere close to Franklin, like New Hampshire, because she missed her father, who had never remarried, and the only cowboy Natasha had loved had left her for someone else.</p><p>She would save a little more money, finish her coursework. She would visit her father, find another job. Maybe schools would be hiring.</p><p>Natasha and the cowboy had been living on a gentrified ranch outside Montana City. The cowboy didn&#x2019;t own the ranch, but he helped take care of the cattle, and he and Natasha had a sweet spot in an apartment above the barn. Natasha was working as a teacher&#x2019;s aide in a second-grade classroom four miles from where they lived. She liked the children and hoped that soon she and the cowboy would marry and have their own family. Two evenings a week, Natasha made the two-hour drive to Missoula where she was enrolled at the University of Montana. The cowboy paid for her classes. He&#x2019;d said she&#x2019;d make a good teacher. But he&#x2019;d gotten lonely on the nights she&#x2019;d been away, and on the other nights when he&#x2019;d wanted her to come to bed and she&#x2019;d stayed up at the kitchen table studying and drinking so much coffee that she didn&#x2019;t go to bed at all.</p><p>She might have forgiven him. He&#x2019;d said a man had needs. She tried to tell him she was sorry, that she would cut back on her classes, that she would stop staying up so late. But the man wasn&#x2019;t interested in reconciling. He was interested instead in a woman he&#x2019;d met, a cute little thing at the feedlot, who had been buying dog food for her allergy-sensitive Irish setter.</p><p>That was when Natasha left the cattle and the sweet spot above the barn. She moved into an apartment in Helena that she could afford on her teacher&#x2019;s aide salary. She continued to make the two-hour drive, two nights a week, to the University of Montana. She didn&#x2019;t think about cowboys or big skies or the smell of cattle. She&#x2019;d think of her father and the picture of her mother on the bureau beside his bed. Brian Freeman, who told his daughter she had her mother&#x2019;s eyes, said he wasn&#x2019;t lonely even though he missed his daughter. He had his job and his friends. He watched the Patriots and went to church and threw office parties. Natasha wasn&#x2019;t like her father. She didn&#x2019;t have any friends. When the cowboy walked out of her life, she&#x2019;d lost the only friend she&#x2019;d had.</p><p>Natasha liked the class she was taking the spring after the cowboy and the little woman and the Irish setter moved in together. Creative Drama and Dance was offered through the theater department and was required for education majors. The course focused on the use of drama and dance as types of educational tools. Natasha was especially fond of the dance portion of the class. She enjoyed the way the music entered her body and rooted her someplace else, her childhood perhaps, when her mother would sway behind the steering wheel, to the melody of a song on the radio, and her fingers would tap out the tempo as she drove. Her voice would sing off-key and Natasha would change the station. Then her mother would swat her daughter&#x2019;s hand and laugh and change the station back.</p><p>Natasha wondered if her mother had been swaying to the music and singing off-key when she slid on the black ice and crashed into a guardrail. While paramedics rushed to the scene, Natasha waited to be picked up from her seventh-grade CCD confirmation class at St. Mary&#x2019;s Catholic Church. Natasha didn&#x2019;t own a cell phone then and everyone else at the parish had already left. She thought her mother would be arriving soon and continued to sit on the curb beside the parking lot. She finally gave up waiting when her fingers began to turn numb, and decided to walk the seven miles home. After thirty minutes, she saw Papa Gino&#x2019;s on her right. She went inside and asked to use a phone. A patron overheard her and said she could use his. She dialed her mother&#x2019;s number, but the call went to voice mail. Then she called her father. He picked up on the first ring. &#x201c;Oh, God, oh, God.&#x201d; He was crying. He said he was sorry. He told her he&#x2019;d be right there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Creative Drama and Dance class was supposed to end at nine. It often let out early, and Natasha would stop by one of the clubs where a local band would be playing. She&#x2019;d order a margarita and find a seat somewhere toward the back of the room. She&#x2019;d drink her margarita slowly to make it last and let the music loosen up something inside her, all that brokenness that she&#x2019;d never paid much mind to. She&#x2019;d find hope on those nights, a brief levity, like a rising tide that would carry her east along Interstate 90 to the exit for Highway 12. She&#x2019;d head over the highlands, a fifty-mile stretch, to the small apartment she&#x2019;d yet to call home. As she drove she&#x2019;d hum tunes from whichever club she&#x2019;d been at and imagine a life different from the one she had. Maybe she&#x2019;d marry a teacher, or an electrician, or a dentist like her dad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These were Natasha&#x2019;s thoughts on that cold Wednesday evening in early December. She&#x2019;d been listening to music at the Top Hat on West Front Street. She&#x2019;d even ordered a second drink. She&#x2019;d liked the band that was playing. After she&#x2019;d listened to the band and had begun to make the drive to Helena, she&#x2019;d felt her sadness lift more than it had on previous days.</p><p>By the time she took the exit for Highway 12 it was later than usual for her, just past eleven, and there was little traffic, only a solitary vehicle here and there. That was why she was startled when a truck came up behind her and flashed its lights. She was a couple of miles outside the little town of Elliston, with about a half hour more to go to her apartment. She thought the driver behind her might want to pass, so she slowed down and veered onto the shoulder. But she&#x2019;d forgotten about the warmer temperatures that day. She hadn&#x2019;t anticipated how soft the shoulder would be. Her right front tire sank a good several inches and then began to spin. Within seconds her back right tire was spinning as well. The truck that had been flashing its lights had already sped on. Natasha kept a shovel in the extra cab of her truck. She climbed out, opened the extra cab extension door, and retrieved the shovel. She wasn&#x2019;t worried. She&#x2019;d gotten stuck before, and despite the fact that the sky was dark and she didn&#x2019;t have a lot of room on the shoulder to work, she was still in a good mood. She dug slush and mud out from around the right front tire, but no matter how much she dug, the ground remained soft.</p><p>For a moment she thought of the cowboy and wished she could call him for help. But then she thought of the cowboy&#x2019;s girlfriend. She would call for a tow truck before she would call her ex-boyfriend, even though she knew the tow truck would cost her more than what she had in her bank account.</p><p>After fifteen minutes, she heard a vehicle approaching from behind her and soon saw the headlights of a truck coming around the corner. She&#x2019;d left her own vehicle running and the lights on so that other vehicles would see her. The truck pulled up beside her. The passenger window was rolled down. A man&#x2019;s voice spoke to her through the rolled-down window, though Natasha couldn&#x2019;t see the man&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a chain in the back of my truck,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;How about I give you a hand?&#x201d;</p><p>The man pulled up just ahead of her truck and got out. He lowered his tailgate and retrieved the heavy chain. He walked to the front of Natasha&#x2019;s truck, and as he did, she heard another vehicle approaching, this time from the opposite direction. The vehicle was a midsize SUV carrying an older couple. The passenger, a woman who looked to be in her sixties, rolled down her window and asked Natasha and the man if they needed help.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re good,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;But thank you,&#x201d; Natasha said. She almost asked if the couple would wait until her truck had been pulled back onto the road. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how comfortable she was being alone with this man whom she didn&#x2019;t know. But she looked at her watch, and it was already going on midnight. The couple was no doubt tired and ready to get home, so Natasha just stood there and waved at the couple as they drove away.</p><p>The man said he&#x2019;d have her on the road in no time. He hooked the chain to her truck&#x2019;s front axle. &#x201c;Where are you coming from to be out so late?&#x201d; he asked her.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t try to make conversation, but she didn&#x2019;t want to seem ungrateful or appear rude, so she told him about her class.</p><p>&#x201c;I take night classes there, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought you looked familiar.&#x201d;</p><p>Natasha felt herself breathe more easily then. This man was also a student, which she took as a good sign.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; he asked her.</p><p>While they stood there and talked, Natasha&#x2019;s truck was still running. Maybe it was because she was tired and it was late, or because of that second drink she&#x2019;d had, but she&#x2019;d forgotten how low on fuel her vehicle was. She climbed in her truck and shifted it into drive so that the man could pull her out of the soft shoulder. That was when she saw that the fuel gauge needle was just a hair above empty. She knew she might not have enough gas to drive the twenty miles or more over the mountains and back to her apartment.</p><p>She had enjoyed talking to the man. She&#x2019;d already thanked him for pulling over to help her. She&#x2019;d learned that he was taking classes in engineering, that he had an apartment in Missoula but was driving to Helena to visit his parents. She&#x2019;d told him it was nice that he was close to his parents and that she missed her father, who was back home in Massachusetts. The man asked her about her mother, and she felt an awakened melancholy that the man seemed to register. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Something terrible must have happened.&#x201d;</p><p>The man drove forward, pulling Natasha&#x2019;s truck back onto the road. At that time another truck approached from the opposite direction. Natasha waved the vehicle on when it slowed down.</p><p>Then the man who had helped her climbed out of his vehicle and walked back toward Natasha. &#x201c;How are you holding up on fuel?&#x201d; he asked her.</p><p>He looked at her fuel gauge before she had a chance to answer and told her to follow him up the road a ways to a pull-off. Then he would give her a ride back to the Elliston Store, which had a fuel station. He said he had a five-gallon gas container in his truck. At first Natasha insisted that she had enough gas to make it back to the store on her own. The man seemed concerned. What if she didn&#x2019;t make it, or the pump was out of order? He assured her he didn&#x2019;t mind giving her a ride. Natasha thought the man was handsome and she didn&#x2019;t want to offend him. She even thought they might be flirting with each other, which she told herself wasn&#x2019;t a good idea.</p><p>He removed the chain and returned it to his truck. As he pulled forward Natasha followed him. The alcohol had worn off and the sky was black. She&#x2019;d stayed up way too late studying the night before. She was tired and eager to get back to her apartment and turn in.</p><p>In a few hundred yards, the man pulled off at a gravel section where in daylight people could view the Continental Divide. Natasha pulled up beside him. She could turn around and head back to Elliston on her own, and yet she was being foolish. She hadn&#x2019;t found a reason not to trust this man. She even entertained the thought of them meeting up after class one night and having a drink together. She shut off her ignition, climbed out, and locked her doors. With her keys in her hand, she walked around her truck and over to the man&#x2019;s vehicle. She opened the passenger door and when she did the interior lights came on that allowed her to see into the extra cab, as well as the bed of the truck. She didn&#x2019;t see a fuel container. The air tightened in her chest for as long as a second. But then she saw a heavy coat in the backseat and thought there might be a fuel container beneath the coat. With that in mind, she climbed into the truck and shut the door. The man was smiling at her. His eyes looked kind and helpful. She realized once more how handsome he was.</p><p>&#x201c;All set?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>Natasha nodded. She wore purple knit gloves on her hands. After she fastened her seat belt, she tucked her hands beneath her legs and stared straight ahead.</p><p>The man pulled back onto the highway and drove west toward Elliston. He continued to talk to her in a friendly way. How did she like her classes? What made her want to be a teacher, and how honorable he thought that was that she wanted to work with kids.</p><p>But then as they approached a gentle curve, the man slowed down more than Natasha thought was necessary. He turned left onto Little Blackfoot River Road.</p><p>Natasha&#x2019;s palms turned clammy inside her gloves and she asked the man what he was doing. He just wanted to check on something, he told her.</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the way to Elliston,&#x201d; Natasha said. She reached for the door with her right hand, but when she did so, she heard the locks click.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>She reached again for the door and tried to unlock it, but the man&#x2019;s arm shot out across her chest and pinned her to the back of the seat, and in his right hand was a knife with a blade about four inches long that was angled precariously close to her neck.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he said in a voice that was tight and loud.</p><p>She tried to speak calmly. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to help each other out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You help me, and I will make sure you get on your way.&#x201d;</p><p>When the truck stopped, she struggled to turn her shoulder away from the man. She reached for the door with both hands, but the man was quicker than she. He&#x2019;d shut off the engine and whipped his right arm over her head and around her neck, the knife still in his hand, and pulled her away from the door. Now his left arm was free, and he wrapped that arm around her as well. He pulled her across the seat toward him. She screamed and kicked her feet against the glass.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; he yelled.</p><p>She tried to bite his arm, but he was still wearing the denim coat and leather gloves.</p><p>He dragged her out of the truck, kicked the door shut behind him, and pulled her around the vehicle, his left hand now held over her mouth. She smelled the rust from the chain he had held earlier and the cold air and her own fear. She tasted blood from her mouth from where she had bitten down on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>As he hauled her downhill in...</p></p><h2>Berlin Red (Inspector Pekkala)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Sam Eastland lives in the US and the UK.

It continued to fly as General George Brett's command ship in Australia and Central and South America until the end of the war and afterward. Like its namesake from a popular l94Os song ("Alexander the Swoose, Half Swan-Half Goose"), the Swoose was a hybrid, with a tail structure, rudder, and elevators from another aircraft and, later, with wings, wheels, and brakes from still other B-17s.<br>Herbert S. Brownstein highlights the Swoose's pioneering flights across the Pacific from the United States, its round-trip flight between Australia and Hawaii that broke speed records, and its celebrity passengers, including Lyndon B. Johnson, General George Brett, and Lowell Thomas. The Swoose recalls the dark days shortly after Pearl Harbor, when a handful of men in their early-model B-17s fought vainly to halt the advance of the invading Japanese forces in the "backyard war" in the Philippines. During the first forty-four days of the war, the Swoose and its counterparts in the 19th Bombardment Group shot down fifty fighters and sank or damaged sixty ships.<br>Drawing on historic photographs and firsthand accounts of pilots, crew members, and passengers, Brownstein chronologically follows the Swoose from its maiden flight in April 1941 to its last, almost thirteen years later, on December 5, 1953, and then to its permanent home in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Air &amp; Space Museum.</p><p></p><h2>A Apple Pie</h2><p><p>In this spectacular recreation of one of the most beloved alphabet rhymes of all time, New York Times Best Illustrator Gennady Spirin brings to life the delicious and whimsical fortunes of an apple pie&#x2014;through the alphabet!

All rights reserved.A 17th-century English alphabet rhyme inspires Spirin's illustrations, which take on a distinctly Victorian tone. Set inside or outside English country houses, the full-bleed paintings and silhouette images teem with rosy-cheeked girls in long flowing dresses, bonnets and sashes, and boys clad in knickers. The top of the page contains each letter printed in capital and lowercase, followed by the same letters and a two- or three-word phrase written in elegant, old-fashioned script: "A, a. Apple Pie/ B, b. Bit it./ C, c. Cut it." Underneath the text, an ivory-colored capital letter serves as each illustration's centerpiece. For example, an <i>A</i> forms an arch, under which a crew of beefeaters plus bakers sporting white hats and aprons carry in an enormous golden pie, while women and children (some riding dappled rocking horses) applaud the parade. For "Q, q. Quartered it," the <i>Q</i>'s oval acts as a peephole into a room where children cluster around an old woman (who could be Mother Goose) cutting a pie. An apple nestles in the bottom corner of each page, with a rotating cast of creatures whose names begin with that page's letter (e.g., <i>G</i> has a grasshopper, <i>H</i>, a horse). Throughout, the recurring characters' postures and facial expressions convey a longing and reverence for apple pie. Spirin's style is especially well suited to this time-proven rhyme.

Also author of In Secret Mongolia Haslund takes us to the lost city of Karakota in the Gobi desert.

Aside from the esoteric and the mystical there is plenty of adventure in it: they journey across the Gobi desert by camel caravan; witness initiation into Shamanic societies; meet reincarnated warlords; and experience the violent birth of modern Mongolia.</p><p>Born in Denmark..</p><h2>My Summer Of Love</h2><p>It's 1984 and one of the hottest summers Yorkshire's seen.

He left behind a record of over eighty books, countless magazine and newspaper articles, and many television and radio interviews. A staunch opponent of increasing militarization, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the U.S. role in Vietnam, Russell is considered by many to be the most influential social critic and political activist of the twentieth century.In 1950, Russell received the Nobel Prize for Literature in recognition of those writings meant for &#34;ordinary citizens.&#34; As the Nobel Committee aptly put it: &#34;Russell has so extensively addressed his books to a public of laymen, and, in so doing, has been eminently successful in keeping alive an interest in general philosophy. His whole life&#39;s work is a stimulating defense of the reality of common sense.&#34;In The Quotable Bertrand Russell, Lee Eisler has combed the whole of Russell&#39;s work to gather his comments and reactions to important social issues, political questions, and heated debates on morals and religion.

In the Quotable Bertrand Russell, Lee Eisler has combed the whole of Russell&#39;s work to harvest his comments and reactions to important issues, political questions, and heated debates on morals and religion. Russell&#39;s views - iconoclastic, humorous, but always enlightening - are formulated as answers to specific questions. Organized alphabetically by topic for ease of reference, it&#39;s provocative, it&#39;s exciting, it&#39;s the very best of Russell.<b>BERTRAND ARTHUR WILLIAM RUSSELL, </b>a&nbsp;prolific writer and&nbsp;considered the cofounder of analytic philosophy, greatly enhanced the fields of mathematics and logic. <br><br>Born to Viscount Amberley and Katherine, daughter of the 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley, at Trelleck on May 18, 1872, Russell was orphaned by age four. Raised by his grandparents, Lord and Countess Russell, young Bertrand received a thorough education from a series of tutors, achieving a perfect knowledge of German and French. <br><br>In 1890 Russell attended Cambridge University, where he studied philosophy and mathematics under such monumental figures as John McTaggart and Alfred North Whitehead. Along with the latter, Russell composed the three-volume <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (1910&#x2013;13), a momentous work that advanced new theories in the study of logic. By introducing such ideas as type theory, <i>Principia Mathematica</i> paved the way for other logicians like Kurt Gï¿½del, among others, to build their own mathematical theories. The authors planned a fourth volume on geometry but never completed the project.<br><br>Analytic philosophy attempts to clarify specific philosophical problems using epistemology and logic. Incoherence and ambiguity seemed to dominate much philosophical thought, and Russell, along with G. E. Moore, fought for clarity and precision in language. Russell employed logic&#x2014;which worked so well in its application to mathematics&#x2014;to philosophy, greatly influencing the history ofthe subject as well as epistemology, metaphysics, and political theory.<br><br>Russell divorced his first wife, Alys Smith, in 1921 and married Dora Black, with whom he had a son and daughter, Conrad and Katherine. He supported his family throughout the decade mainly by writing on topics as&nbsp;diverse as physics and education in terms that the general reader could understand. Along with his wife, Russell founded an experimental institution called the Beacon Hill School in 1927. <br><br>Concern for general social issues dominated much of Russell&#x2019;s public life. In the early 1900s, he advocated suffrage for women. During World War I, he was thrown in jail for penning a pacifist pamphlet. Before the Second World War, he favored a policy of appeasement, but, by 1941, he recognized the necessity of Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s defeat in order to preserve democracy. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Russell protested the Korean and Vietnam conflicts as as well as the development of nuclear arms.<br><br>Russell&#x2019;s strong beliefs on social matters sometimes clashed with his academic life. In 1916 he was dismissed from his post at Trinity College, Cambridge University, after being jailed for writing a pacifist pamphlet. In <i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i> (1927), Russell described religion&#x2019;s detrimental effects and later argued for agnosticism in <i>A Free Man&#x2019;s Worship</i> (1903). Public outcry forced a court to revoke his contract with the City College of New York, deeming him morally unqualified to teach in 1940. Ironically, much of Russell&#x2019;s moral outlook was, in fact, based on his paternal grandmother&#x2019;s Christian influence&#x2014;she admonished him to embrace Exodus 23:2, &#x201c;Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,&#x201d; which Russell admitted shaped him throughout his life. Still, Russell remained an agnostic&#x2014;like his father&#x2014;who leaned toward atheism. <br><br>In 1949 Russell was awarded the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize in Literature the next year. Russell died on February 2, 1970, of influenza at the age of ninety-seven.<br><br>His many works include <i>Principles of Mathematics</i> (1903); <i>Principles of Social Reconstruction</i> (1916); <i>Roads to Freedom</i>: <i>Socialism, Anarchism and Syndicalism</i> (1918);<i> The Problem of China</i> (1922); <i>Power: A New Social Introduction to Its Study</i> (1938); <i>Authority and the Individual&nbsp;</i>(1949); and <i>Unpopular Essays</i> (1950).</p><h2>Spiritual Space: The Religious Architecture of Pietro Belluschi</h2><p>A survey and appreciation of 43 Belluschi (dean architecture, MIT through 1973) churches with a selection of seven of his essays.

A combined version of these essays, first published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, begins this volume.<br><br>Because his statement was important and controversial both as a&nbsp;commentary on the history of economic thought and as a theoretical contribution in its own right, the <i>Journal of Political Economy </i>in 1972 presented critical reviews from noted monetary theorists, including Karl Brunner and Allan H. Meltzer, James Tobin, Paul Davidson, and Don Patinkin. Their studies, which are printed in the present volume, focus on substantive issues, covering a variety of topics. All of their major points are discussed in Friedman's reply, which clarifies and expands upon his original themes and introduces interesting new material. Thus the synthesis of his two articles, the critical comments, and his response, together with an introduction by Robert J. Gordon, are combined in one volume for the convenience of scholars and students.</p><p><b>Milton Friedman</b> (1912&#x2013;2006) was an economist who taught at the University of Chicago for more than three decades. He was a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and is known for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and the complexity of stabilization policy. He was a principal founder of what has come to be known as the Chicago School of Economics. He was&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-known public champion of laissez-faire capitalism.&nbsp;In 1962 the University of Chicago Press published <i>Capitalism and Freedom,</i> one of the most influential books of the twentieth century. In 1998 the Press published <i>Two Lucky People</i>, the memoir by Milton and Rose Friedman of their joint lives and work. In reviewing the book in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, David Brooks wrote: &#x201c;This is a book that restores your faith in reasoned discourse.... There really are people who believe in scholarly exchange as a way to discover truth.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>A Day with the Animal Builders</h2><p>he Animal Builders have a new apprentice.

The outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939 led to cautious attempts to raise volunteer organizations among American men and women, to back the armed forces in the event of the USA becoming directly involved in the conflict. The attack on Pearl Harbor caused a huge surge of patriotic response, and voluntary enlistment in a wide range of auxiliary and civilian support services, as well as the armed forces, swelled vastly. Looking first at the background and general character of wartime life in the States, Alejandro de Quesada covers the main services, providing an interesting comparison with the conditions on the British Home Front and the experiences of other countries caught up in the war, examining organizations from the Red Cross to the Coast Guard. Full-color artwork reconstructions of the uniforms of over a dozen services are a unique feature of this book.</p><p><p>Alejandro de Quesada is a Florida-based military history writer, an experienced researcher and collector of militaria, photos and documents and runs an archive and historical consulting for museums as well as for films as a secondary business with a strong Military History content. He has written over 100 articles and over 25 books, including several for Osprey, and is a leading authority on Latin-American subjects.&nbsp;</p><p>Author of the following Osprey titles to date:&nbsp;The Spanish-American War and Philippine Insurrection;&nbsp;The US Home Front 1941-45;&nbsp;Roosevelt's Rough Riders; The Bay of Pigs;&nbsp;The Mexican Revolution;&nbsp;The United States Coast Guard during World War Two;&nbsp;Spanish Colonial Fortifications in North America.</p><p>&#x201c;The back cover of The US Home Front 1941-45 noted that many of the organizations presented in the book are 'quite forgotten since 1945.' This effort of Alejandro de Quesada's is a rather good attempt at passing on the history of these auxiliary, patriotic, humanitarian, and other war-time organizations in the United States during the WW2 era.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>C. Peter Chen, World War II Database (February 26, 2008)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Overall another superlative book and one that is both an interesting and enjoyable read. I'm sure you will agree.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Scott Van Aken, modelingmadness.com (February 2008)</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is useful as a broad look at the home front, and will whet the appetite for the reader to dig deeper into the specific topics of interest... He successfully presents a comprehensive overview of various aspects of life in an America at war... This title is an excellent overview of America's home front and is a worthy addition to the Osprey Elite line-up.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Scott Mingus, Charge! (February 27, 2008)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Despite early unwillingness to combat Hitler there was a massive rallying to the flag after Pearl Harbor, and this extended to a large number of civilian support organizations... They're all described here, with their uniforms shown by a good selection of photographs as well as the excellent colour plates. Excellent reference for figure modelers! Recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Prigent, Internet Modeler (March 2008)</i></p><p>&#x201c;De Quesada's snapshot of the America home front fills in the blanks and reinforces the idea that a nation's total commitment and undivided support is vital if it wishes to win a war.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>World War II History (March 2009)</i></p></p><h2>The Snow Child</h2><p>Alaska, 1920: a brutal place to homestead, and especially tough for recent arrivals Jack and Mabel. Childless, they are drifting apart--he struggling to maintain the farm; she crumbling from loneliness and despair. In a moment of levity during the first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning the snow child is gone--but they glimpse a young girl running through the trees.This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness. As Jack and Mabel come to understand this child who could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale, they begin to love her as their own daughter. But in this beautiful, violent territory things are rarely as they appear, and what they eventually learn about Faina will transform them all.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2012</strong>: In her haunting, evocative debut Eowyn Ivey stakes her claim on a Russian fairy tale, daring the reader--and the characters--to be lulled into thinking they know the ending. But, as with the Alaskan wilderness, there&#x2019;s far more here than meets the eye. On the surface it&#x2019;s the story of a childless pioneer couple running from their East Coast lives and struggling to survive in the harshest of climates while also attempting to reconnect with each other; but it&#x2019;s also the story of the spring of hope that bubbles out of new friendships, of the slow realization of love for a surrogate child, of the ties between man and nature. Ivey spares no words in describing the beauty and the danger of her native Alaska, bringing the sheer magnitude of the wilderness alive on every page. With the transparent prose of a fairy tale and descriptions to put nature writing to shame, <em>The Snow Child</em> immerses readers in a 1920s Alaska that will draw them back again and again. --<em> Malissa Kent</em> <br>Named after a character from J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s The Lord of the Rings, Eowyn Ivey currently works at an independent bookstore in Palmer, Alaska. Before that, she was a reporter and editor for the Frontiersman newspaper and won a number of awards, including Best Non-Daily Columnist from the Alaska Press Club. Several of her short stories have been published in the anthology, Cold Flashes, and the literary journal, Cirque. Eowyn lives in Alaska with her husband and two daughters.

A potter who has been working with porcelain for more than forty years, de Waal describes how he set out on five journeys to places where porcelain was dreamed about, refined, collected and coveted--and that would help him understand the clay's mysterious allure. From his studio in London, he starts by travelling to three "white hills"--sites in China, Germany and England that are key to porcelain's creation. But his search eventually takes him around the globe and reveals more than a history of cups and figurines; rather, he is forced to confront some of the darkest moments of twentieth-century history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part memoir, part history, part detective story, <i>The White Road </i>chronicles a global obsession with alchemy, art, wealth, craft and purity. In a sweeping yet intimate style that recalls <i>The Hare with Amber Eyes</i>, de Waal gives us a singular understanding of "the spectrum of porcelain" and the mapping of desire.</p><p>EDMUND DE WAAL is one of the world's leading ceramic artists, and his porcelain is held in many major museum colletions.

I nearly didn't notice when his thoughts touched mine. It was a rare thing these days; rarer still that I would let him in, but my own thoughts were drifting and I knew that his were, too. In fact, from what I saw of where he was-the angle of the ceiling and the dimly shadowed walls-I guessed that he was likely still in bed, just waking up himself.</p> <p>I didn't need to push him out. Already he was drawing back, apologizing. Sorry. Not a spoken word, but still I heard the faint regretful tone of his familiar voice. And then he wasn't there.</p> <p>A man sat heavily beside me, squeezed me over on the seat, and with my senses feeling raw already, even that unwanted contact was too much. I stood, and braced myself against the bit of wall beside the nearest door and forced myself to balance till we came to Bond Street. When the doors slid open, I slid safely back into the comfort of routine, my brisk steps keeping pace with everybody else as we became a texting, talking, moving mass that flowed together up and out and through the turnstiles and emerged onto the pavement where we went our separate ways, heads down and purposeful.</p> <p>The morning was a lovely one for August. The oppressive sticky heat had given way to fresher air that promised warmth but didn't threaten, and the sky was a pristine and perfect blue.</p> <p>I barely saw it. I was thinking of that shadowed room, a grayer light that spoke of clouds or maybe rain, a hand that had come lazily in view, to rub his eyes while he was waking. It had been his left hand, and there'd been no rings on it. At least, I didn't think I'd seen a ring on it.</p> <p>I caught my thoughts before they had a chance to wander further and betray me. Doesn't matter, I reminded myself firmly, and to make quite sure I heard myself I said the words aloud: "It doesn't matter."</p> <p>I could feel the glances of the people walking closest to me, wondering if I were off my trolley, and I flushed a little, tucking my head well down as I came round the corner and into South Molton Street, a little pedestrian haven of upscale shops, cafï¿½s, and galleries. Everything always seemed quieter here, with the mad rush of Bond Street behind me. I carried on down past the graceful old buildings with beautiful doors to the one with the freshly white-painted faï¿½ade where an expensive-looking brass plaque with fine lettering read: Galerie St.-Croix, Fine Russian Artefacts and Art, Third Floor.</p> <p>The naming of the gallery had been one of Sebastian's little vanities-in spite of his French surname, he was English through and through, born of a line that likely traced its Hampshire roots back to the Conquest. But Sebastian knew his business, and to art dealers like him, it was essential to create the proper image.</p> <p>I was part of that, I knew, because I had the proper look, the proper pedigree, the right credentials, and I always dressed to fit the part. But when he'd hired me two years ago, he'd also made no secret of the fact that it had been for my abilities-not only that I held a master's degree in Russian Studies and the History of Art, but also that I spoke fluent Russian besides, and my organized nature appealed to his strong sense of order, and I had, what he'd called then, "potential."</p> <p>He'd worked to transform me, to mentor me, teaching me how to get on the right side of the bid at an auction, and how to finesse our more difficult clients. I'd come a long way from the rather unworldly young woman I'd been when he'd taken me on.</p> <p>He had transformed the gallery building as well. We were on the third floor, in a space that today was as richly detailed as a penthouse. Even the lift was mirrored, which this morning didn't thrill me.</p> <p>I was frowning as it opened to the elegant reception room where a flower-seller painted by Natalia Goncharova hung above the desk at which our previous receptionist had sat. She'd had to leave us unexpectedly, and I'd been interviewing this past week to fill the vacancy, while Sebastian and I shared out the extra duties.</p> <p>It was not an easy thing to hire a person who could suit Sebastian's tastes, aesthetically. He wanted something more than simple competence, or class. He wanted someone who embodied what the Goncharova painting did-the painting he had hung above that desk, where it would be the first thing noticed by each customer who stepped into the gallery.</p> <p>He'd had offers for it. Several of our clients could afford to pay a million pounds with ease, but then Sebastian didn't need the money.</p> <p>"If I sell the thing," he'd told me once, "then I'll have only satisfied one client. If I leave it where it is, then every one of them will think it can be theirs one day."</p> <p>It didn't only work with art. It wasn't a coincidence that many of our loyal and best customers were women, and they looked upon Sebastian as they did that Goncharova flower-seller, as a prize that could be won, with time and effort.</p> <p>In fact, as I passed by his glass-walled office on the way down to my own, I saw he had a woman with him now. I would have left them to their business, but he saw me and beckoned me in, so I pushed the door open and joined them.</p> <p>Sebastian's smile was all professional, with me, and even if it hadn't been, I would have been immune to it. He was too rich to be my type. A gold watch flashed beneath his tailored sleeve as he leaned forward, looking so immaculate, I half-suspected that he had a team of stylists working on him every morning, from his polished shoes right to the tousled toffee-colored hair that had been combed with just the right amount of carelessness.</p> <p>"Nicola," he introduced me, "this is Margaret Ross. Miss Ross, my associate, Nicola Marter."</p> <p>Miss Margaret Ross was not what I'd expected, not our usual sort of client. For one thing, she was plainly dressed but dressed with so much care I knew she'd taken pains to look her best. And although I was usually quite good at guessing ages, I had trouble guessing hers. She had to be a decade older than myself, so nearing forty at the least, but while her clothing and the way she held herself suggested she might be still older, there was something in her quiet gaze that seemed distinctly youthful, even innocent.</p> <p>"Good morning." She was Scottish. "I'm afraid that I've been wasting Mr. St.-Croix's time."</p> <p>Sebastian, ever charming, shook his head. "No, not at all. That's what I'm here for. And even if it can't be proved, you still have a fascinating story to tell your grandchildren."</p> <p>She cast her eyes down as though she were hiding disappointment. "Yes."</p> <p>"Tell Nicola." Sebastian's tone was meant to salve her feelings, make her feel that what she had to say was fascinating, even if it wasn't. He was good that way. To me, he said, "She brought this carving in for an appraisal."</p> <p>It looked to me, at first, an undistinguished lump of wood that curved to fit his upraised palm, but when I looked again, I saw it was a small carved bird, wings folded tightly to its sides, a sparrow or a wren. Sebastian was saying, "It's been in her family... how long?"</p> <p>Margaret Ross roused herself to his smooth prompting. "Nearly three hundred years, so I'm told. It was given to one of my ancestors by Empress Catherine of Russia. Not Catherine the Great," she said, showing her knowledge. "The first Catherine."</p> <p>Sebastian smiled encouragement. "Peter the Great's widow, yes. So, the 1720s sometime. And it very well might be that old." Holding the carving as though it were priceless, he studied it.</p> <p>Margaret Ross told him, "We call it the Firebird. That's what it's always been called, in our family. It sat under glass in my grandmother's house, and we children were never allowed to come near it. My mother said"-there was the tiniest break in her voice, but she covered it over-"she said, with Andrew gone-Andrew's my brother, he died in Afghanistan-with him gone, and me not likely to have any family myself now, my mother said there was no point in the Firebird sitting there, going to waste. She said I should sell it, and use all the money to travel, like I'd always wanted to do."</p> <p>"Miss Ross," said Sebastian, to me, "lost her mother quite recently."</p> <p>I understood his manner now, his sympathy. I told her, "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"That's all right. She had MS; it wasn't the easiest life for her. And she felt guilty for having me there to look after her. But," she said, trying to smile, "I looked after my aunties as well, till they passed, and she was my own mother. I couldn't have left her alone, could I?"</p> <p>Looking again at her eyes, I decided their youthfulness came from the fact that she'd never been able to live her own life as a woman. She'd put her own life in limbo while caring for others. I felt for her. And I felt, too, for the mother who'd hoped that her daughter would sell their one prized family heirloom, and finally have money and comfort to live just a little. To travel.</p> <p>"The thing is," Sebastian said, kindly, "without any documentation or proof, what we dealers call provenance, we simply can't know for certain. And without that provenance, I'm afraid this poor creature has little real value. We can't even tell if it's Russian." He looked at me. "Nicola? What would you say?"</p> <p>He passed it to me and I took it, not thinking, forgetting my mind had already been breached once this morning. It wasn't until I was holding it, light in my hands, that I realized I'd made a mistake.</p> <p>Instantly I felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the carving itself. I closed my eyes to try to stop the vision, but that only made it worse. I saw a slanting fall of light, with fine dust dancing through it. Two women, one aging but lovely, with heavy black eyebrows; the other respectfully bent, perhaps kneeling, her young face upturned in uncertainty. "My darling Anna," the first woman said to the other in elegant Russian, and smiled. "You were never a nobody."</p> <p>I opened my eyes quickly, maybe a little too quickly, but to my relief no one seemed to have noticed. "I really don't know," I said, giving the small carved bird back to Sebastian.</p> <p>He looked at it with a commendable blend of admiration and regret.</p> <p>"The trouble is," he told our would-be client, "it's so difficult to date this sort of thing with any certainty. If it is Russian, it was very likely peasant-made; there is no maker's mark or factory stamp to go by, and without any documentation..." He raised one shoulder slightly in a shrug that seemed to speak to the unfairness of it all. "If she had brought you back an icon, now, this ancestor of yours, or some small piece of jewelry-that I might have helped you with."</p> <p>"I understand," said Margaret Ross. Her tone was bleak.</p> <p>Sebastian turned the little carving over in his hands one final time, and I knew he was searching for some small thing to praise, to let this woman down as gently as he could. "Certainly it's very old," was what he ended up with, "and I'm sure it's had a few adventures."</p> <p>Margaret Ross wasn't sure about that. "It's been sitting there under that glass for as long as I've known it, and likely it sat there a good while before that."</p> <p>The twist of her faint smile held sympathy, as though she knew how that felt, to be there on the mantelpiece watching the bright world pass by, and I saw the small sag of defeat in her shoulders as, accepting Sebastian's return of the carved bird, she started to carefully wrap it back up in its layers of yellowed, creased tissue.</p> <p>Impulse drove me to ask aloud, "What was her name?"</p> <p>She looked up. "Sorry?"</p> <p>"Your ancestor. The one who brought your Firebird back from Russia."</p> <p>"Anna. That's all we know of her, really, we don't know her surname. It was her daughter married into the Ross family, that's how the Firebird came down to us."</p> <p>Anna. Something tingled warmly up my arm. My darling Anna...</p> <p>"Because maybe," I suggested, "you could try a bit of research, to establish some connection between her and Empress Catherine."</p> <p>From Sebastian's glance I couldn't tell if he was grateful or annoyed, but he chimed in with, "Yes, if you were able to find proof of any kind, that would be useful."</p> <p>Again that faint twist of a smile that spoke volumes about how much hope she held now of discovering that. She admitted, "My granny tried once, so she said, but no joy. Common people, they don't make the history books. And on our side of the family, there's nobody famous."</p> <p>I saw the warm smile in my mind. Heard the voice. You were never a nobody.</p> <p>"Well," said Sebastian, beginning to stand, "I am sorry we couldn't be more of a help to you. But if you'll leave us your address, we'll keep it in mind, and if ever a client requests something like it..."</p> <p>I felt like a traitor, as Margaret Ross stood, too, and shook both our hands. The feeling held as we escorted her back out into reception, and Sebastian, with full chivalry and charm, gave her his card and wished her well and said good-bye. And as the lift doors closed he turned to me and, reading the expression in my eyes, said, "Yes, I know."</p> <p>Except he didn't.</p> <p>There was no way that he could have known. In all the time I'd worked for him I'd never told him anything about what I could do, and even if I'd told him, he'd have rubbished the idea. "Woo-woo stuff," he would have called it, as he'd done the day our previous receptionist had told us she was visiting a psychic.</p> <p>"No," she'd said, "she really sees things. It's this gift she has-she holds a thing you've owned, see, like a necklace, or a ring, and she can tell you things about yourself. It's called psychometry." She'd said the term with confident authority.</p> <p>Sebastian, with a sidelong look, had said, "It's called a scam. There is no way that anyone can be a psychic. It's not possible."</p> <p>I'd offered him no argument, although I could have told him he was wrong. I could have told him I was psychic, and had been for as long as I remembered. Could have told him that I, too, saw detailed visions, if I concentrated on an object someone else had held. And sometimes, like today, I saw the visions even when I didn't try, or concentrate, although that happened very, very rarely now.</p> <p>The flashes of unwanted visions had been more a feature of my childhood, and I had to close my eyes and truly focus now to use my "gift"-my curse, I would have called it. I had chosen not to use it now for years.</p> <p>Two years, to be exact.</p> <p>I'd chosen to be normal, and I meant to go on being normal, having the respect of those I worked with, not their nudges or their stares. So there was no good reason why, when I sat down at the computer in my office, I ignored the string of waiting emails and began an image search instead.</p> <p>I found three portraits, different in their poses and the sitter's age, but in all three I recognized the woman easily because of her black hair, her heavy arching eyebrows, and her warm dark eyes. The same eyes that had smiled this morning in the brief flash of a vision I had viewed when I had held the wooden Firebird.</p> <p>There could be no mistaking her: the first Empress Catherine, the widow of Peter the Great.</p> <p>"Damn," I whispered. And meant it.</p></p><h2>Spiritual Serendipity: Cultivating and Celebrating the Art of the Unexpected</h2><p>The author of Don&#39;t Just Do Something, Sit There! provides a guide to developing serendipity of the spirit in an effort to balance structure and spontaneity, harness time rather that manage it, and provide a bridge to God. 40,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Richard Eyre</b> is the author or coauthor of sixteen books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Teaching Your Children Values.</i> A Harvard trained management consultant in his preserendipity life, he now writes more poetry and enters more tennis tournaments.

Two years of Excel shortcuts and five hundred of HBS's notorious business case studies lay ahead of him, but he couldn't have told you what OCRA was, other than a vegetable, or whether discount department stores make more money than airlines. He did, however, know that HBS's alumni appeared to be taking over the world. The US president, the president of the World Bank, the US treasury secretary, the CEOs of General Electric, Goldman Sachs and Proctor &amp; Gamble - all were bringing HBS experience to the way they ran their banks, businesses and even countries. And with the prospect of economic enlightenment before him, he decided to see for himself exactly what they teach you at Harvard Business School. Philip Delves Broughton's hilarious and enlightening account of his experiences within Harvard Business School's hallowed walls provides an extraordinary glimpse into a world of case study conundrums, guest lectures, Apprentice-style tasks, booze luging, burn-outs and high flyers. And with HBS alumni heading the very global governments, financial institutions and FTSE 500 companies whose reckless love of deregulation and debt got us into so much trouble, he discovers where HBS really adds value - and where it falls disturbingly short.</p><p>Philip Delves Broughton has served as New York and Paris bureau chief for the Daily Telegraph and led its coverage of the 9/11 attacks on New York.

In this careful, balanced look at Abraham Lincoln's stirring 1854 Peoria, Ill., speech, writer and historian Lehrman finds a "prelude to greatness" that put the little-known lawyer and politician on the path to national prominence while laying the intellectual groundwork for his presidency. The subject was slavery, already the great question of 19th century America, recently reignited with the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act that repealed earlier anti-slavery laws for certain new territories. Arguing that the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Independence extended to African-Americans, Lincoln took an abolitionist position daring for any politician with national ambitions (though he did not go so far as to advocate for full social or political equality). Lehrman also considers Lincoln's Illinois nemesis, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, sponsor of the new Kansas-Nebraska Act who spoke at Peoria before Lincoln as a stalwart booster of "the rights of whites to enslave blacks." Ably building on the drama of Lincoln's anti-slavery efforts through subsequent years, culminating in his ascent to the presidency, Lehrman's detailed chronicle, rich in first-person accounts, lays out the case that from his earliest public forays, Lincoln was no ordinary leader. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The elm trees snag them. So does the harbor and the wild roses and the history.'' Cantwell does, of course, manage to leave town, but the town remains inside her, and, here, she brings it to her readers all the way back from its history of colonial immigrants and traders, of General LaFayette (who once camped there, but left when winter set in) and of ``Philip, King of the Wampanoags'' (the bones of whose people lie under the ground)--and on through the lives of her beloved grandparents, known as Ganny and Gampy (she still believes Gampy was once a bootlegger); of her own parents, Leo Cantwell and Mary Lonergan; and thus to the birth and growing up of Mary Lee Cantwell and her younger sister, Diana. Seldom have a town and its memoirist been more perfectly blended than they are here (``It was as if Bristol were a book I couldn't put down,'' says the author), and in her subtle and delicately told tales of being a young child, of getting polio, of remembering WW II, of learning the stark cruelties of social class, of struggling into adolescence, of finally graduating from high school and getting ready to leave home--in all of these, Cantwell embraces sentiment without ever becoming sentimental, and makes her words fall into place with a quiet perfection. ``If I don't get out of Bristol it will always be three o'clock in the afternoon,'' she says; and yet, even so, amid much, much more, she remembers for us a long-ago afternoon with her high-school girlfriends when ``we walked through air that was as silver as the bay.'' Evocative, lovely, deeply felt, and mature personal writing about a past that's gone. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>For Cantwell, a New York Times editorial board member, 1930s Bristol, R.I., was such a charmed setting to grow up inplease, don't take such liberties in rewriting, when you haven't read the book.gs that her chronic case of "Bristol Complaint"--inability to leave the coastal town behind--is contagious. A serene, evocative writer, she makes readers tenants of 232 Hope St., which houses three generations of her family: father Leo, production manager at the rubber plant; mother Mary, onetime third-grade teacher; younger sister Diana; good pal seems awk to describe woman as 'buddy'?/i've changed it to pal, but confidante is totally out of keeping with tone of book. gs Aunt Esther; Ganny, a model of rectitude even if she lays an occasional bet with her bookie; and Gampa, who is unfailingly content "because he wants no more at this moment." Rarely do the rich summer folk or the Italian and Portuguese immigrants intrude on this snug world as family members make their way among the Friday-night after-movie crowd at the soda fountain of Buffington's Drugstore or spend an afternoon at the Bluebird Shoppe for Ganny's corset fitting. Cantwell's account of such a childhood is a bit Booth Tarkingtonish, but readers weary of anguished coming-of-age memoirs will feel refreshed. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Southwest Flavors: Santa Fe School of Cooking</h2><p>In this long-awaited follow-up to the original Santa Fe School of Cooking Cookbook, authors Susan Curtis and Nicole Curtis Ammerman share dozens of new recipes, techniques, traditions, and flavors from one of America's culinary hotspots.

S. Lewis has gained recent skepticism. Many twenty-first-century critics of Christianity believe the biblical portrait of Jesus Christ is based on myth. Lord or Legend? puts skeptics&#39; claims to the test against multiple scholarly disciplines--including history, ethnography, anthropology, and folklore--to uncover fascinating truths about the historical Jesus. Authors Gregory A. Boyd and Paul Rhodes Eddy address pressing questions like: ï¿½ Was first-century Judaism an environment for pagan mythological beliefs? ï¿½ How are the Gospels accurate if they originated through oral tradition? ï¿½ Do similarities between Jesus and other myths discredit Christianity? ï¿½ Are the Scriptures historically accurate? Biased? Translated accurately? ï¿½ Do archeological findings support or refute biblical accounts? Lord or Legend? is written in an accessible form for all lay readers whether believers in or skeptics of Christianity.</p><p>Did Jesus ever really exist--and if so, who was he? &#34;This is a marvelous study of the historicity of the gospels and the reliability of the biblical narrative. At times this book reads like a good detective story: it lays out the clues and the methods of evaluating those clues, and then draws conclusions based on the best evidence. From the most ancient witnesses, like Josephus and Irenaeus, to contemporary critics like Burton Mack, the authors ably rebut the critics&#39; claims of inconsistency and historical error. They further explore the value of the fantasy works of popular writers like C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien . . . . This book is intended for the general reader, the average churchgoer who may be struggling with difficult questions about the Jesus story. It&#39;s a fascinating and valuable work that merits a wide readership.&#34;--Publishers Weekly &#34;Boyd and Eddy do not shy away from the tough historical, cultural, textual, and logical questions and their implications. Both those of a modernist and those of a postmodernist bent will find this a helpful clarification of issues relating to the truth about the historical Jesus.&#34;--Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament, Asbury Theological Seminary &#34;Boyd and Eddy present a compelling case that the Gospels were composed using eyewitness accounts passed down from the earliest followers of Jesus. This volume should be read by anyone interested in the ongoing discussion of the reliability of the Gospels and the truth about the historical Jesus.&#34;--Mark L. Strauss, professor of New Testament, Bethel Seminary San Diego &#34;This accessible reference tool provides an overview that answers many of the major criticisms that circulate in both scholarship as well as in the popular media. Some of the issues included here are rarely treated elsewhere.&#34;--Gary R. Habermas, distinguished research professor and chair, department of philosophy and theology, Liberty University Gregory A. Boyd is the senior pastor at Woodland Hills Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the author of numerous books, including Letters from a Skeptic.

He lives in Virginia.Gardner rouses himself for more elaborate plotting than usual in his tenth stint as Ian Fleming's stand-in, but Gardner's James Bond, on loan to the KGB for some antiterrorist housecleaning, has aged a lot less gracefully than Sean Connery. A dissident Russian cabal calling itself The Scales of Justice (SoJ) has kidnapped somebody it claims is Josif Vorontsov, notorious second-in-command at Babi Yar, from his home in New Jersey and threatened to assassinate high-level brass hats until the government takes Vorontsov off their hands and places him on trial for war crimes. When the Kremlin denies that SoJ has the real Vorontsov and refuses to recognize his extradition, SoJ begins taking out high-level brass hats, and the KGB asks British Intelligence to let them have somebody--guess who--able to infiltrate SoJ by substituting for two English-speaking recruits. Gardner lays some promising trails--Bond working for the KGB, Bond partnered by Mossad agent Pete Natkowitz, two interloping French agents (one a natural bedmate), the news that SoJ intends to videotape its own free-lance war-crimes trial, and all the usual seductions, killings, double-crosses, flashbacks, and intimations of The End (this time by hard-liners bombing Washington while the US is busy bombing Baghdad)--but the going keeps getting muddier, as if somebody else had finished the book over a third martini (shaken, not stirred). Bond saves the world, gets the woman and the Order of Lenin, and turns in a less muffled performance than in last year's Brokenclaw, though still below average for Gardner's series. Let's not talk about how far below Fleming's average. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Trapped in desperate poverty and confronted with unthinkable tragedies, all Andrew ever wanted was to be with his mom. But as her mental health steadily declined, and with no one else left to care for him, authorities arrived and tore Andrew from his screaming mother's arms. In that moment, the life he knew came crashing down around him. He was only seven years old.<p>Hope was institutionalized, and Andrew was placed in what would be his devastating reality for the next eleven years--foster care. After surviving one of our country's most notorious children's facilities, Andrew was thrust into a savagely loveless foster family that refused to accept him as one of their own. Deprived of the nurturing he needed, Andrew clung to academics and the kindness of teachers. All the while, he refused to surrender the love he held for his mother in his heart. Ultimately, Andrew earned a scholarship to Wesleyan, went on to Harvard Law School, and became a Fulbright Scholar.</p><p>Andrew has dedicated his life's work to helping children living in poverty and in the foster care system. He defied the staggering odds set against him, and here in this heartwrenching, brutally honest, and inspirational memoir, he reveals who Hope's boy really is.</p></p><p><strong>Andrew Bridge</strong> earned a scholarship to Wesleyan, and went on to Harvard Law School and was a Fulbright Scholar. He has dedicated his life to giving a voice to the thousands of children tragically reliving his youth by defending the rights of children nationwide. Today, Andrew lives in New York City.David Drummond's delivery of narrative is straightforward and well paced. In delivering dialogue, however, heartfelt emotions color his reading. In this memoir young Andy is taken from his mother, Hope, when she shows neither the mental nor financial ability to care for him. Drummond's portrayal of Andy has the longing and wistfulness of a son who adores his mother and grieves their parting. In foster homes, Drummond portrays Andy as a good boy, despite his subtle defiance. One foster mother, Mrs. Leonard, is easily enraged, and Drummond's harsh Germanic tones for her character are effectively menacing. He is also spot-on in his characterizations of the social workers who do little to aid the boy's suffering.

When she climbs her favorite tree, she can look down into the beautiful garden below. She can also see the small house next door where her friend Rosario and her family live. One day she sees Rosario and her brother dragging her tricycle into their yard and hiding it under a pile of boxes. Margarita decides to lie and protect her friends &#x2014; but is she really helping them? This sensitive story illustrated in magic realist style powerfully presents complex issues of friendship, maturity, and social standing.</p><p>Class differences are seldom part of stories for very young children, but this book tells of rich and poor from the viewpoint of young Margarita, who climbs a tree on her rich family's estate and sees the shacks on the other side of the hedge, where her friend Rosario lives. Margarita watches as Rosario and her brother take her tricycle, but she doesn't say anything about it, even when her mother's lunch guests spew prejudice ("They're all thieves"). The pictures show the Latino characters in a tropical setting, playing with the thick, leafy hedge that separates them. The text is spare, and the richly colored acrylic art, reminiscent of Anthony Browne's work, is just on the edge of magical realism. Although there is no overt message, there is much to talk about.

Someone who would care for me more than he cared for himself. A guy who would never betray me, never lie to me, and most of all never leave me. Yeah, that was what I desired most, what people usually call true love.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if that has really changed.<br> <br>Yet I have to wonder now if I want something else just as badly.<br> <br>What is it? You must wonder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Magic. I want my life filled with the mystery of magic.<br> <br>Silly, huh? Most people would say there&#x2019;s no such thing.<br> <br>Then again, most people are not witches.<br> <br>Not like me.<br> <br>I discovered what I was when I was eighteen years old, two days after I graduated high school. Before then I was your typical teenager. I got up in the morning, went to school, stared at my ex-boyfriend across the campus courtyard and imagined what it would be like to have him back in my life, went to the local library and sorted books for four hours, went home, watched TV, read a little, lay in bed and thought some more about Jimmy Kelter, then fell asleep and dreamed.<br> <br>But I feel, somewhere in my dreams, I sensed I was different from other girls my age. Often it seemed, as I wandered the twilight realms of my unconscious, that I existed in another world, a world like our own and yet different, too. A place where I had powers my normal, everyday self could hardly imagine.<br> <br>I believe it was these dreams that made me crave that elusive thing that is as great as true love. It&#x2019;s hard to be sure, I only know that I seldom awakened without feeling a terrible sense of loss. As though my very soul had been chopped into pieces and tossed back into the world. The sensation of being on the &#x201c;outside&#x201d; is difficult to describe. All I can say is that, deep inside, a part of me always hurt.<br> <br>I used to tell myself it was because of Jimmy. He had dumped me, all of a sudden, for no reason. He had broken my heart, dug it out of my chest, and squashed it when he said I really like you, Jessie, we can still be friends, but I&#x2019;ve got to go now. I blamed him for the pain. Yet it had been there before I had fallen in love with him, so there had to be another reason why it existed.<br> <br>Now I know Jimmy was only a part of the equation.<br> <br>But I get ahead of myself. Let me begin, somewhere near the beginning.<br> <br>Like I said, I first became aware I was a witch the same weekend I graduated high school. At the time I lived in Apple Valley, which is off Interstate 15 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. How that hick town got that name was beyond me. Apple Valley was smack in the middle of the desert. I wouldn&#x2019;t be exaggerating if I said it&#x2019;s easier to believe in witches than in apple trees growing in that godforsaken place.<br> <br>Still, it was home, the only home I had known since I was six. That was when my father the doctor had decided that Nurse Betty&#x2014;that was what my mom called her&#x2014;was more sympathetic to his needs than my mother. From birth to six I lived in a mansion overlooking the Pacific, in a Malibu enclave loaded with movie stars and the studio executives who had made them famous. My mom, she must have had a lousy divorce lawyer, because even though she had worked her butt off to put my father through medical school and a six-year residency that trained him to be one of the finest heart surgeons on the West Coast, she was kicked out of the marriage with barely enough money to buy a two-bedroom home in Apple Valley. And with summer temperatures averaging above a hundred, real estate was never a hot item in our town.<br> <br>I was lucky I had skin that gladly suffered the sun. It was soft, and I tanned deeply without peeling. My coloring probably helped. My family tree is mostly European, but there was an American Indian in the mix back before the Civil War.<br> <br>Chief Proud Feather. You might wonder how I know his name, and that&#x2019;s good&#x2014;wonder away, you&#x2019;ll find out, it&#x2019;s part of my story. He was 100 percent Hopi, but since he was sort of a distant relative, he gave me only a small portion of my features. My hair is brown with a hint of red. At dawn and sunset it is more maroon than anything else. I have freckles and green eyes, but not the green of a true redhead. My freckles are few, often lost in my tan, and my eyes are so dark the green seems to come and go, depending on my mood.<br> <br>There wasn&#x2019;t much green where I grew up. The starved branches on the trees on our campus looked as if they were always reaching for the sky, praying for rain.<br> <br>I was pretty; for that matter, I still am pretty. Understand, I turned eighteen a long time ago. Yet I still look much the same. I&#x2019;m not immortal, I&#x2019;m just very hard to kill. Of course, I could die tonight, who&#x2019;s to say.<br> <br>It was odd, as a bright and attractive senior in high school, I wasn&#x2019;t especially popular. Apple Valley High was small&#x2014;our graduating class barely topped two hundred. I knew all the seniors. I had memorized the first and last name of every cute boy in my class, but I was seldom asked out. I used to puzzle over that fact. I especially wondered why James Kelter had dumped me after only ten weeks of what, to me, had felt like the greatest relationship in the world. I was to find out when our class took that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas.<br> <br>Our weekend in Sin City was supposed to be the equivalent of our Senior All-Night Party. I know, on the surface that sounds silly. A party usually lasts one night, and our parents believed we were spending the night at the local Hilton. However, the plan was for all two hundred of us to privately call our parents in the morning and say we had just been invited by friends to go camping in the mountains that separated our desert from the LA Basin.<br> <br>The scheme was pitifully weak. Before the weekend was over, most of our parents would know we&#x2019;d been nowhere near the mountains. That didn&#x2019;t matter. In fact, that was the whole point of the trip. We had decided, as a class, to throw all caution to the wind and break all the rules.<br> <br>The reason such a large group was able to come to such a wild decision was easy to understand if you considered our unusual location. Apple Valley was nothing more than a road stop stuck between the second largest city in the nation&#x2014;LA&#x2014;and its most fun city&#x2014;Las Vegas. For most of our lives, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, we watched as thousands of cars flew northeast along Interstate 15 toward good times, while we remained trapped in a fruit town that didn&#x2019;t even have fruit trees.<br> <br>So when the question arose of where we wanted to celebrate our graduation, all our years of frustration exploded. No one cared that you had to be twenty-one to gamble in the casinos. Not all of us were into gambling and those who were simply paid Ted Pollack to make them fake IDs.<br> <br>Ted made my ID for free. He was an old friend. He lived a block over from my house. He had a terrible crush on me, one I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know about. Poor Ted, he confided everything in his heart to his sister, Pam, who kept secrets about as well as the fifty-year-old gray parrot that lived in their kitchen. It was dangerous to talk in front of that bird, just as it was the height of foolishness to confide in Pam.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure why Ted cared so deeply about me. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t understand why I cared so much about Jimmy. At eighteen I understood very little about love, and it&#x2019;s a shame I wasn&#x2019;t given a chance to know more about it before I was changed. That&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ll always regret.<br> <br>That particular Friday ended up being a wasteland of regrets. After a two-hour graduation ceremony that set a dismal record for scorching heat and crippling boredom, I learned from my best friend, Alex Simms, that both Ted and Jimmy would be driving with us to Las Vegas. Alex told me precisely ten seconds after I collected my blue-and-gold cap off the football field&#x2014;after our class collectively threw them in the air&#x2014;and exactly one minute after our school principal had pronounced us full-fledged graduates.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, right?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Alex brushed her short blond hair from her bright blues. She wasn&#x2019;t as pretty as me but that didn&#x2019;t stop her from acting like she was. The weird thing is, it worked for her. Even though she didn&#x2019;t have a steady boyfriend, she dated plenty, and there wasn&#x2019;t a guy in school who would have said no to her if she&#x2019;d so much as said hi. A natural flirt, she could touch a guy&#x2019;s hand and make him feel like his fingers were caressing her breasts.<br> <br>Alex was a rare specimen, a compulsive talker who knew when to shut up and listen. She had a quick wit&#x2014;some would say it was biting&#x2014;and her self-confidence was legendary. She had applied to UCLA with a B-plus average and a slightly above-average SAT score and they had accepted her&#x2014;supposedly&#x2014;on the strength of her interview. While Debbie Pernal, a close friend of ours, had been turned down by the same school despite a straight-A average and a very high SAT score.<br> <br>It was Debbie&#x2019;s belief that Alex had seduced one of the interviewing deans. In Debbie&#x2019;s mind, there was no other explanation for how Alex had gotten accepted. Debbie said as much to anyone who would listen, which just happened to be the entire student body. Her remarks started a tidal wave of a rumor: &#x201c;ALEX IS A TOTAL SLUT!&#x201d; Of course, the fact that Alex never bothered to deny the slur didn&#x2019;t help matters. If anything, she took great delight in it.<br> <br>And these two were friends.<br> <br>Debbie was also driving with us to Las Vegas.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a mix-up,&#x201d; Alex said without much conviction, trying to explain why Jimmy was going to ride in the car with us. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t plan for both of them to come.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would anyone in their right mind put Jimmy and me together in the same car?&#x201d; I demanded.<br> <br>Alex dropped all pretense. &#x201c;Could it be that I&#x2019;m sick and tired of you whining about how he dumped you when everything was going so perfect between you two?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glared at her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re best friends! You&#x2019;re required to listen to my whining. It doesn&#x2019;t give you the right to invite the one person in the whole world who ripped my heart out to go on a road trip with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What road trip? We&#x2019;re just giving him a three-hour ride. You don&#x2019;t have to talk to him if you don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. The five of us are going to be crammed into your car half the afternoon and it will be perfectly normal if I don&#x2019;t say a word to the first and last guy I ever had sex with.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex was suddenly interested. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know Jimmy was your first. You always acted like you slept with Clyde Barker.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clyde Barker was our football quarterback and so good-looking that none of the girls who went to the games&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;cared that he couldn&#x2019;t throw a pass to save his ass. He had the IQ of a cracked helmet. &#x201c;It was just an act,&#x201d; I said with a sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, it might work out better than you think. My sources tell me Jimmy has hardly been seeing Kari at all. They may even be broken up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kari Rider had been Jimmy&#x2019;s girlfriend before me, and after me, which gave me plenty of reason to hate the bitch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we be absolutely sure and invite Kari as well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She can sit on my lap.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex laughed. &#x201c;Admit it, you&#x2019;re a tiny bit happy I did all this behind your back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a tiny bit considering not going at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare. Ted would be devastated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ted&#x2019;s going to be devastated when he sees Jimmy get in your car!&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex frowned. &#x201c;You have a point. Debbie invited him, not me.&#x201d;<br> <br>On top of everything else, Debbie had a crush on Ted, the same Ted who had a crush on me. It was going to be a long three hours to Las Vegas.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Debbie think it was a good idea for Jimmy to ride with us?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was aghast. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it. That bitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, actually, she didn&#x2019;t think there was a chance in hell he&#x2019;d come.&#x201d;<br> <br>That hurt. &#x201c;Love the vote of confidence. What you mean is Debbie didn&#x2019;t think there was a chance in hell Jimmy was still interested in me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. But you both thought it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Jessie. It&#x2019;s obvious Jimmy&#x2019;s coming with us so he can spend time with you.&#x201d; Alex patted me on the back. &#x201c;Be happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you wait until now to tell me this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because now it&#x2019;s too late to change my devious plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>I dusted off my blue-and-gold cap and put it back on. &#x201c;I suppose this is your graduation present to me?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Where&#x2019;s mine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it when we get to Las Vegas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; I already had a feeling I was going to pay her back, I just didn&#x2019;t know how.</p><h2>Passage at Arms</h2><p><b>The Bestselling author of The Black Company Delivers a classic novel of military science fiction</b><br><br>The ongoing war between Humanity and the Ulant is a battle of attrition that Humanity is losing.

SHUCKED is part love letter, part memoir and part documentary about the world's most beloved bivalves. An in-depth look at the work that goes into getting oysters from farm to table, SHUCKED shows Erin's full-circle journey through the modern day oyster farming process and tells a dynamic story about the people who grow our food, and the cutting-edge community of weathered New England oyster farmers who are defying convention and looking ahead. The narrative also interweaves Erin's personal story&#x2015;the tale of how a technology-obsessed workaholic learns to slow life down a little bit and starts to enjoy getting her hands dirty (and cold). This is a book for oyster lovers everywhere, but also a great read for locavores and foodies in general.</p></p><p><p><b>ERIN BYERS MURRAY</b> is a Boston area journalist, specializing in food and wine writing.

He learned of a seafaring culture which 6,000 years ago, used arcane navigation arts to guide initiates unerringly across the Pacific wih no compasses, no charts. By the time of Christ, these navigators were pushing on through all of Oceania, populating nearly a quarter of the Earth's surface. Thomas ventured to the tiny coral atolls of Micronesia in search of these mysteries, this ancient language of the sea.

Before that he hosted This Old House, for 14 years. Beginning in 1977, Steve logged many blue-water miles sailing a 43-foot wooden sloop from England to San Francisco via the Panama Canal, Galapagos, Marquesas and Hawaii. In the early 1980s, he journeyed to the remote Micronesian island of Satawal to learn the ancient technique of star path navigation under the master navigator Mau Piailug. Steve's research resulted in this book, The Last Navigator, published in 1987 and a documentary for PBS&#x2019;s Adventure series. Steve received his bachelor's degree in philosophy from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.

Beneath her, Farinelli, the big palomino gelding, continued his quick walk eastward along the dusty road that ran south of the Chean River toward the former ford at Sorprat. Anna glanced sideways at Himar, the sandy-haired captain--overcaptain now--whose mustache drooped more than usual--perhaps from the road dust...perhaps from sweat. Two of her personal guards flanked them--Rickel on her left, and beyond and slightly back of Himar, Lejun. An overcaptain, personal guards--sometimes it was still hard to believe that she was Regent and Sorceress of Defalk, and Lady of Mencha.<br>Less than two years earlier, she had been Anna Marshall, struggling assistant professor of voice in Ames, Iowa, a divorcï¿½e mourning the death of her eldest daughter. Then, a spell sung in Defalk and her own ill-uttered wish to be anywhere but Ames had thrown her into the intrigues and battles of Liedwahr, both colored by the ever-present male chauvinism, a chauvinism that so often she seemed the only one to recognize, even after she&#x2019;d survived three attempted rapes. Because the world of Erde was governed by the harmonies--and song magic that worked--those struggles she faced were more deadly than the faculty politics of Ames. <em>But only slightly</em>, Anna reflected as she thought of the fate of untenured and discarded junior faculty members at the universities where she had taught over the years.<br>The late-summer sun had burned the back of her neck, despite her ever-present felt hat, and the sweat that oozed from her hair added to the stinging. In her green trousers and shirt, and floppy brown hat, she scarcely looked like a regent. Only the gold-trimmed purple vest betrayed the slightest indication of rank--that and her position at the head of the column that stretched a good hundred yards behind her.<br>An older-looking woman with red hair liberally streaked with white rode up alongside Himar, clearing her throat to announce herself.<br>Anna turned toward her chief player. &#x201c;Yes, Liende?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lady...the players are tired...especially young Delvor.&#x201d;<br>Anna glanced at the road ahead, rising slowly to a crest perhaps a dek away--roughly a kilometer in earth terms--then back to Liende. &#x201c;I suspect all the armsmen are tired, too,&#x201c; Anna temporized, blotting the sweat from her forehead. &#x201c;Everyone can rest a little when we get to Sorprat. I mean, this side of the river. I think it should be only two or three deks from here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Four at the most,&#x201c; added Himar.<br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be that long,&#x201c; Anna promised.<br>&#x201c;As you say, lady.&#x201d; The woodwind player nodded, then let her mount drop back.<br>The air was still, so hot that the browned grasses to the south of the road hung limply in the heat. Road dust coated the legs of the horses, and a finer film covered the riders&#x2019; legs. Anna rubbed her nose, gently, wondering why she had ended up breathing so much road dust. <em>Because there wasn&#x2019;t any other way</em>?<br>Himar eased his mount closer to Anna, his eyes on the pair of scouts nearing the rise in the road almost a dek ahead. &#x201c;I will be glad when you have completed this task, lady,&#x201c; the overcaptain said in a low voice, &#x201c;and you can return to Falcon.&#x201d;<br>Anna nodded. Lord Jecks would also be glad when she returned, since the white-haired and still-young-faced lord of Elheld had questioned the need for her mission, even though he was the grandfather of young Jimbob, the heir to Defalk, for whom Anna ruled as Regent. <em>Regent for a youth not always grateful. Yet you&#x2019;ve used your sorcery for Jimbob when you can&#x2019;t even use it to see your own children.</em><br><em>She swallowed, her throat even drier than from road dust alone. Would she ever be able to use the mirrors and her song magic to see Elizabetta again? Or Mario?</em><br><em>&#x201c;Lord Jecks was concerned about this task,&#x201c; Himar added, unnecessarily.</em><br><em>The blond-haired Rickel--head of her personal guard--smiled, if briefly, before the professional indifference again masked his amusement at Himar&#x2019;s acknowledgment of Jecks&#x2019; protectiveness of the sorceress.</em><br><em>Anna hadn&#x2019;t realized how much she missed Jecks, but she&#x2019;d insisted that he remain in Falcor to heal from his wounds. In their efforts to drive the Sturinnese out of Dumar, to save Anna he&#x2019;d thrown himself into the enchanted javelin hurled by the Sea-Priest of Sturinn. She still wasn&#x2019;t sure that she would have been able to do something like that to save someone else--not the immediate and selfless way Jecks had done to save her. She moistened her lips at the memory.</em><br><em>Jecks had not been happy with her decision to leave Falcor--especially for the ten days it would take, and he had been quite forceful. &#x201c;I do not see why you insist on riding out to Sorprat...you do not need a ford there. Not this year. What crops there are come from the lower valley, and the peasants and farmers can use the bridge at Pamr. For another year or so, there will be little enough trade with Ebra. What there is can take the old road on the south side of the Chean River.&#x201d;</em><br><em>Except that the old road adds almost two days travel to Mencha--and Ebra--and you may need those days all too soon</em>. In fact, her own journey to repair the ford was on the old road, and even pushing, it would take a day more--but she knew she needed to be on the south side to see what she could do to undo the mess she&#x2019;d made of the ford when she&#x2019;d created a giant sinkhole to swallow the Ebran invaders. And she <em>felt</em>that repairing the ford was necessary. She ignored solid gut feelings at her own peril, and the ford&#x2019;s destruction had been nagging at her for well over a year.<br>As she rode across the high bluff on the south side of the river, Anna glanced to her left, northward out across the river, across the green valley that--everywhere away from the irrigation ditches--had been brown and dusty little more than a year earlier. She did not look forward to revisiting the site of the battle with the Dark Monks of Ebra--except that it had been more of a slaughter than a battle. Even under the hot sun of late summer, she shivered, recalling the screams and the terrible grinding of the earth as her song-sorcery had churned the muddy waters of the Chean River over the trapped soldiers.<br>The column crossed the low rise in the road and started on the gentle downgrade toward the point on the south bank of the river opposite the town of Sorprat--or what of it had been rebuilt after the destruction wrought by Anna&#x2019;s magic. It still astounded her that &#x201c;good&#x201d; or harmonic song magic-Clearsong--could create such massive destruction, often with not too great a side effect on Anna. Yet the smallest of Darksong spells--even those which would have obviated the need for destructive Clearsong--could prostrate her, possibly threaten her life. <em>Another unfairness that you can do nothing about...because that&#x2019;s the way this world operates. Period</em>. She put that thought aside and concentrated on the spell she would have to use shortly.<br>Before long, she reined up Farinelli short of where the high grassland ended--abruptly. Himar gestured, and a trumpet signal echoed through the early afternoon. Behind them, the column slowed and halted. Anna patted Farinelli on the shoulder, and the gelding nodded ever so slightly as if to suggest that he indeed deserved some thanks.<br>Where the plateau ended, what had once been a sinkhole was now a circular and placid lake, smaller than it had been, and cut off from the Chean River by a low muddy rise barely three yards above the lake&#x2019;s surface. The water was still brownish. Below the sorcery-cut bluffs, between the base of the bluffs and the water&#x2019;s edge, instead of beaches, mud slopes angled into the murky lake.<br>&#x201c;It is peaceful now,&#x201c; said Himar quietly. &#x201c;One would hardly know that thousands perished there.&#x201d;<br>Anna nodded. Ten thousand Ebrans. <em>Dark Monks</em>, she added mentally. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re close enough.&#x201d;<br>Himar turned his mount and stood in the stirrups. &#x201c;Stand down!&#x201d;<br>As she thought about the Ebrans, Anna almost wanted to shake her head. Hadrenn, the Ebran Lord of Synek, had beseeched her to accept his fealty. She had, and in making him one of the thirty-three lords of Defalk, thereby effectively added a quarter of Ebra to Defalk. <em>And probably ensured another war in Ebra</em>. One way or another there would have been war in Ebra, she reminded herself, between Hadrenn and Bertmynn, the noble who had taken the title of Lord of Dolov and sought to unite all Ebra under his rule. The difference was that Hadrenn had a legitimate claim to lands that had been seized from his father, and sought only those lands, while Bertmynn was willing to sell out to the Liedfuhr of Mansuur and the Sturinnese to rule all of Ebra. <em>And the Sturinnese chain their women</em>.<br>Anna dismounted. For a moment, as she grasped the cantle of the saddle with one hand, she wasn&#x2019;t sure if her legs would hold. After she took the bottle that still held water, she drank slowly. She recorked the bottle and replaced it in the holder before walking slowly in the open road before Farinelli to stretch her legs. Next came the vocalises, to clear her cords of dust, and the mucus from allergies that Brill&#x2019;s youth spell had done nothing to remedy.<br>&#x201c;Holly-lolly-pop....&#x201d;<br>Behind her, horses sidestepped, and the armsmen murmured hi voices so low that the sound was more like locusts than men. She shook her head, then began another vocalise, hoping that getting her cords clear would not take forever.<br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; snapped Himar, and the murmuring died away.<br>When Anna felt her cords were clear, she walked back to the gelding and extracted from the left saddlebag the sketc...</strong></p></p><h2>The Minimalist Guide To Prepping: Being Prepared Without Being Obsessed: Prepper &amp; Survival Training Just In Case The SHTF Off The Grid, Practical ...

In five novels published over five years as well as a string of stories, he transformed the mystery genre into literature and left us with the figure of the hard-boiled detective, from the Continental Op to Sam Spade&#x2014;immortalized on film by Humphrey Bogart in <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>&#x2014;and the more glamorous Thin Man, also made iconic with the aid of Hollywood. A brilliant writer, Hammett was a complex and enigmatic man. After 1934 until his death in 1961, he published no more novels and suffered from a writer&#x2019;s block that both shamed and maimed him. He is identified with his tough protagonists, but his tuberculosis compromised his masculine identity and alcoholism may have been his answer. A former Pinkerton detective who valued honesty, he was attracted to women who lied outrageously, most notably Lillian Hellman, with whom he conducted a thirty-year affair. A controversial political activist who stood up for civil liberty, he was also a very private man. In this compact new biography, Sally Cline uses fresh research, including interviews with Hammett&#x2019;s family and Hellman&#x2019;s heir, to reexamine the life and works of the writer whom Raymond Chandler called &#x201c;the ace performer.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>Sally Cline</strong> is an award-winning writer and scholar and the author of twelve books, including biographies of Zelda Fitzgerald and Radclyffe Hall. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.VERDICT: <i> Man of Mystery</i> delivers the goods on Hammett, in brief. . . . Keeping her subject squarely in focus, [Cline] offers a fairly succinct overview of his personality and career. Her analyses of his novels including <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> and <i>The Thin Man</i>, are lean. . . . What is found in abundance are salacious details, presented in standard linear narrative, as Hammett lifetime consumptive, philander, and inebriate extraï¿½ordinaire treats people badly against an endless backdrop of crummy apartments, hotel penthouses, jail cells, army barracks, and Hollywood locales. . . .

For Goldmann, a leading exponent of the most fruitful method of applying Marxist ideas to literary and philosophical problems, the &#34;tragic vision&#34; marked an important phase in the development of European thought, as it moved from rationalism and empiricism to the dialectical philosophy of Hegel, Marx and Lukï¿½cs. Here he offers a general approach to the problems of philosophy, of literary criticism, and of the relationship between thought and action in human society.</p><p><b>Lucien Goldmann</b> was a French philosopher and sociologist of Jewish-Romanian origin.

Unfortunately this misconception has left us without a coherent understanding of the revolutionary history of the twentieth century. Recent study has suggested there are many more similarities between the two ideologies than originally thought. The book traces that relationship by following the progressive decay of Marxist theory over seven decades as it devolves into a variant of Fascism.</p><p>James Gregor, professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley and adjunct professor at Marine Corps University, has written extensively on fascism.The Roman god Janus represents beginnings and endings, the gateway to all knowledge. Gregor (political science, Univ. of California, Berkeley; Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time), who has written extensively on fascism, takes issue with 20th-century historians who make fascism and communism the opposing faces of Janus. OCLC WorldCat indicates the availability of over 600 works on fascism in the 1990s, but Gregor is the first to use Marxist theory systematically to bend the political spectrum from a linear to a circular form. That is, fascism and communism meld into each other. Fascism had its origins in communism, and communism exhibited facets of fascism from its inception. Since the Soviet empire broke up, its logical course is toward fascism. The real political spectrum Gregor sees is democratic and nondemocratic: "The fact is that what is now spoken of as 'communofascism' and 'Stalinofascism' serves as testimony to affinities long recognized by those who have refused to place the revolutions of the twentieth century on a continuum from Left to Right." Gregor uses the repetition of key points to convince his audience but uses subtle changes in each new chapter to move his argument forward in small increments. Recommended for all political science collections, this book supplements The Black Book of Communism (LJ 11/1/99).<br><i>-Harry V. Willems, Southeast Kansas Lib.

Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean, its purpose to fight China&#x2019;s vicious nineteenth-century Opium Wars. As for the crew, they are a motley array of sailors and stowaways, coolies and convicts. In a time of colonial upheaval, fate has thrown together a diverse cast of Indians and Westerners, from a bankrupt Raja to a widowed tribeswoman, from a mulatto American freedman to a free-spirited French orphan. As their old family ties are washed away, they, like their historical counterparts, come to view themselves as jahaj-bhais, or ship brothers. An unlikely dynasty is born, which will span continents, races, and generations. The vast sweep of this historical adventure embraces the lush poppy fields of the Ganges, the rolling high seas, and the crowded backstreets of Canton. But it is the panorama of characters, whose diaspora encapsulates the vexed colonial history of the East itself, that makes Sea of Poppies so breathtakingly alive &#x2013; a masterpiece from one of the world&#x2019;s finest novelists.

Her village was so far inland that the sea seemed as distant as the netherworld: it was the chasm of darkness where the holy Ganga disappeared into the Kala-Pani, &#x2018;the Black Water&#x2019;.</p><p>It happened at the end of winter, in a year when the poppies were strangely slow to shed their petals: for mile after mile, from Benares onwards, the Ganga seemed to be flowing between twin glaciers, both its banks being blanketed by thick drifts of white-petalled flowers. It was as if the snows of the high Himalayas had descended on the plains to await the arrival of Holi and its springtime profusion of colour.</p><p>The village in which Deeti lived was on the outskirts of the town of Ghazipur, some fifty miles east of Benares. Like all her neighbours, Deeti was preoccupied with the lateness of her poppy crop: that day, she rose early and went through the motions of her daily routine, laying out a freshly washed dhoti and kameez for Hukam Singh, her husband, and preparing the rotis and achar he would eat at midday. Once his meal had been wrapped and packed, she broke off to pay a quick visit to her shrine room: later, after she&#x2019;d bathed and changed, Deeti would do a proper puja, with flowers and offerings; now, being clothed still in her night-time sari, she merely stopped at the door, to join her hands in a brief genuflection.</p><p>Soon a squeaking wheel announced the arrival of the ox-cart that would take Hukam Singh to the factory where he worked, in Ghazipur, three miles away. Although not far, the distance was too great for Hukam Singh to cover on foot, for he had been wounded in the leg while serving as a sepoy in a British regiment. The disability was not so severe as to require crutches, however, and Hukam Singh was able to make his way to the cart without assistance. Deeti followed a step behind, carrying his food and water, handing the cloth-wrapped package to him after he had climbed in.</p><p>Kalua, the driver of the ox-cart, was a giant of a man, but he made no move to help his passenger and was careful to keep his face hidden from him: he was of the leather-workers&#x2019; caste and Hukam Singh, as a high-caste Rajput, believed that the sight of his face would bode ill for the day ahead. Now, on climbing into the back of the cart, the former sepoy sat facing to the rear, with his bundle balanced on his lap, to prevent its coming into direct contact with any of the driver&#x2019;s belongings. Thus they would sit, driver and passenger, as the cart creaked along the road to Ghazipur&#x2014;conversing amicably enough, but never exchanging glances.</p><p>Deeti, too, was careful to keep her face covered in the driver&#x2019;s presence: it was only when she went back inside, to wake Kabutri, her six-year-old daughter, that she allowed the ghungta of her sari to slip off her head. Kabutri was lying curled on her mat and Deeti knew, because of her quickly changing pouts and smiles, that she was deep in a dream: she was about to rouse her when she stopped her hand and stepped back. In her daughter&#x2019;s sleeping face, she could see the lineaments of her own likeness&#x2014;the same full lips, rounded nose and upturned chin&#x2014;except that in the child the lines were still clean and sharply drawn, whereas in herself they had grown smudged and indistinct. After seven years of marriage, Deeti was not much more than a child herself, but a few tendrils of white had already appeared in her thick black hair. The skin of her face, parched and darkened by the sun, had begun to flake and crack around the corners of her mouth and her eyes. Yet, despite the careworn commonplaceness of her appearance, there was one respect in which she stood out from the ordinary: she had light grey eyes, a feature that was unusual in that part of the country. Such was the colour&#x2014;or perhaps colourlessness&#x2014;of her eyes that they made her seem at once blind and all-seeing. This had the effect of unnerving the young, and of reinforcing their prejudices and superstitions to the point where they would sometimes shout taunts at her&#x2014;chudaliya, dainiya&#x2014;as if she were a witch: but Deeti had only to turn her eyes on them to make them scatter and run off. Although not above taking a little pleasure in her powers of discomfiture, Deeti was glad, for her daughter&#x2019;s sake, that this was one aspect of her appearance that she had not passed on&#x2014;she delighted in Kabutri&#x2019;s dark eyes, which were as black as her shiny hair. Now, looking down on her daughter&#x2019;s dreaming face, Deeti smiled and decided that she wouldn&#x2019;t wake her after all: in three or four years the girl would be married and gone; there would be enough time for her to work when she was received into her husband&#x2019;s house; in her few remaining years at home she might as well rest.</p><p>With scarcely a pause for a mouthful of roti, Deeti stepped outside, on to the flat threshold of beaten earth that divided the mud-walled dwelling from the poppy fields beyond. By the light of the newly risen sun, she saw, greatly to her relief, that some of her flowers had at last begun to shed their petals. On the adjacent field, her husband&#x2019;s younger brother, Chandan Singh, was already out with his eight-bladed nukha in hand. He was using the tool&#x2019;s tiny teeth to make notches on some of the bare pods&#x2014;if the sap flowed freely overnight he would bring his family out tomorrow, to tap the field. The timing had to be exactly right because the priceless sap flowed only for a brief period in the plant&#x2019;s span of life: a day or two this way or that, and the pods were of no more value than the blossoms of a weed.</p><p>Chandan Singh had seen her too and he was not a person who could let anyone pass by in silence. A slack-jawed youth with a brood of five children of his own, he never missed an opportunity to remind Deeti of her paucity of offspring. Ka bhaï¿½l? he called out, licking a drop of fresh sap from the tip of his instrument. What&#x2019;s the matter? Working alone again? How long can you carry on like this? You need a son, to give you a helping hand. You&#x2019;re not barren, after all . . .</p><p>Being accustomed to her brother-in-law&#x2019;s ways, Deeti had no difficulty in ignoring his jibes: turning her back on him, she headed into her own field, carrying a wide wicker basket at her waist. Between the rows of flowers, the ground was carpeted in papery petals and she scooped them up in handfuls, dropping them into her basket. A week or two before, she would have taken care to creep sideways, so as not to disturb the flowers, but today she all but flounced as she went and was none too sorry when her swishing sari swept clusters of petals off the ripening pods. When the basket was full, she carried it back and emptied it next to the outdoor chula where she did most of her cooking. This part of the threshold was shaded by two enormous mango trees, which had just begun to sprout the dimples that would grow into the first buds of spring. Relieved to be out of the sun, Deeti squatted beside her oven and thrust an armload of firewood into last night&#x2019;s embers, which could still be seen glowing, deep inside the ashes.</p><p>Kabutri was awake now, and when she showed her face in the doorway, her mother was no longer in a mood to be indulgent. So late? she snapped. Where were you? Kï¿½m-o-kï¿½j na hoi? You think there&#x2019;s no work to be done?</p><p>Deeti gave her daughter the job of sweeping the poppy petals into a heap while she busied herself in stoking the fire and heating a heavy iron tawa. Once this griddle was heated through, she sprinkled a handful of petals on it and pressed them down with a bundled-up rag. Darkening as they toasted, the petals began to cling together so that in a minute or two they looked exactly like the round wheat-flour rotis Deeti had packed for her husband&#x2019;s midday meal. And &#x2018;roti&#x2019; was indeed the name by which these poppy-petal wrappers were known although their purpose was entirely different from that of their namesake: they were to be sold to the Sudder Opium Factory, in Ghazipur, where they would be used to line the earthenware containers in which opium was packed.</p><p>Kabutri, in the meanwhile, had kneaded some atta and rolled out a few real rotis. Deeti cooked them quickly, before poking out the fire: the rotis were put aside, to be eaten later with yesterday&#x2019;s leftovers&#x2014;a dish of stale alu-posth, potatoes cooked in poppy-seed paste. Now, her mind turned to her shrine room again: with the hour of the noontime puja drawing close, it was time to go down to the river for a bath. After massaging poppy-seed oil into Kabutri&#x2019;s hair and her own, Deeti draped her spare sari over her shoulder and led her daughter towards the water, across the field.</p><p>The poppies ended at a sandbank that sloped gently down to the Ganga; warmed by the sun, the sand was hot enough to sting the soles of their bare feet. The burden of motherly decorum slipped suddenly off Deeti&#x2019;s bowed shoulders and she began to run after her daughter, who had skipped on ahead. A pace or two from the water&#x2019;s edge, they shouted an invocation to the river&#x2014;Jai Ganga Mayya ki . . . &#x2014;and gulped down a draught of air, before throwing themselves in.</p><p>They were both laughing when they came up again: it was the time of year when, after the initial shock of contact, the water soon reveals itself to be refreshingly cool. Although the full heat of summer was still several weeks away, the flow of the Ganga had already begun to dwindle. Turning in the direction of Benares, in the west, Deeti hoisted her daughter aloft, to pour out a handful of water as a tribute to the holy city. Along with the offering, a leaf flowed out of the child&#x2019;s cupped palms. They turned t...</p></p><h2>Sondheim &amp; Co</h2><p>"Sondheim &amp; Co" is the complete, behind-the-scenes story of the making of Stephen Sondheim's musicals. Written with the full co-operation of Sondheim himself, it examines each of Sondheim's masterpieces - including "West Side Story", "Gypsy", "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", "Company", "Follies", "A Little Night Music", "Sweeney Todd", "Sunday in the Park with George" and "Into the Woods" - as well as the other Sondheim productions on Broadway, Off-Broadway, in repertory, as revivals, as opera, on film, and on television. this account is based on hundreds of hours of interviews with Sondheim and his associates.</p><p>This is an updated and revised version of the author's 1974 study of Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, including the four shows he has produced since A Little Night Music. Sondheim's creative genius has shaped the contemporary musical, and Zadan interweaves comments by Sondheim's colleagues with a wealth of information about the shows to display the composer's enormous talent. As in the first edition, the focus is on Sondheim's career and accomplishments, and biography is skimpy, except for some isolated, tantalizing facts. But no matter; the detail about the process of putting together a show, plus the profuse illustrations and appendixes containing production information, etc., add up to required reading for all musical theater lovers. Highly recommended, even to libraries owning the first edition.Eric W.

You&#39;ve laughed along with millions of others. And you&#39;ve learned new euphemisms for poop, which can come in handy if you&#39;re ever apparated back to junior high. But who creates all these ads? Glad you asked. It&#39;s Harmon Brothers. From Poop to Gold takes you behind the scenes of some of the most successful video ads in internet history-and the lessons learned along the way. A stunning number of hilarious videos that have &#34;gone viral&#34;-and which have also managed to sell huge quantities of product (think of Squatty Potty&#39;s pooping unicorn as just one example)-have one thing in common: they were created by this small group of people from a small-ish town in Provo, Utah. With awards from AdAge, Unruly, ADWEEK, and a WEBBY for Best Writing, Harmon Brothers-and their revolutionary model-transform poop into gold, and can do the same for you and your company. Originally more of a history of Harmon Brothers, From Poop to Gold changed in form as it changed its author, Chris Jones. He began to see dozens of applications of the Harmon Brother&#39;s business model, and ways From Poop to Gold could potentially be much more than just a recitation of facts. Author Chris Jones pulls back the curtain and reveals the behind-the-scenes magic including their innovative business model, one of the biggest secrets behind their success. American business is often dysfunctional, a clear contrast to the often chaotic but always collegial-and successful-model at Harmon Brothers. More, the HB system both treats its employees like adults and allows them to behave like human beings, unique and powerful in their own ways.

Shortlisted for the Waterstone&#39;s Children&#39;s Book Prize 2019, Klaus Flugge Prize 2019 and Independent Bookshop Week Awards 2019 There was once a little boy who was afraid of the dark. There&#39;s nothing unusual about that. Most children are afraid of the dark at one time of another. But this little boy was a Prince, and he decided that when he became King, he would do something about the dark. He would ban it. When a King bans the dark completely, installing an artificial sun, and enforcing &#34;anti-dark&#34; laws, it seems like a good idea. The citizens don&#39;t need to worry about monsters, crime, or any of the other scary things that might live in the dark. But what happens when nobody can sleep, and the citizens revolt? Will the King face his fears and turn the lights off? The King Who Banned the Dark is a beautiful story about how we need the dark in order to enjoy the light.</p><p></p><h2>Free Speech or Propaganda?: How the Media Distorts the Truth</h2><p>Shows how the media distorts the news, in the newspapers, on television, and on the radio, and explains how to decipher truth in the midst of media bias</p><p></p><h2>Freedom Song: Three Novels</h2><p>What most immediately galvanizes the reader of <b>Freedom Song</b> is the elegance and idiosyncrasy of Amit Chaudhuri's writing. In the words of Salman Rushdie: "[His] languorous, elliptical, beautiful prose is impressively impossible to place in any category at all." And it is this quality of ineffability that gives Chaudhuri's words the power they have to reveal--slowly, quietly, with a richness of sensual detail and subtle humor--the significance of the ordinary moments of life.<br><br>A boy spends a summer and a winter with his parents in a Bombay high-rise, and spends other summers in Calcutta immersed in the more traditional life of his uncle's extended family . . . A young man at Oxford, whose memories of home in Bombay bring both comfort and melancholy, faces a choice between "clinging to my Indianness, or letting it go, between being nostalgic or looking toward the future". . . The members of a Calcutta family are occupied with the task of finding the right woman for the twenty-eight-year-old son who would rather occupy himself with politics . . .<br><br>In these three short novels--<b>Freedom Song, Afternoon Raag,</b> and <b>A Strange and Sublime Address</b> ("The best portrait of India today I've read," wrote Margaret Drabble)--Chaudhuri illuminates the surprisingly nuanced intimate worlds of middle-class Indian men, women, and children. The novels brim with the author's stunning evocations of place and time, and his radiant descriptions and subtle explorations of the expected and surprising events of daily life; the effects of family connectedness and separation; the desires and demands of youth and age; the things and events that confirm "how mysterious the world [is] at every moment"; the hidden complexities of a fully lived inner life. From these elements Amit Chaudhuri shapes mesmerizing narratives, uncovering the remarkable in what might otherwise seem merely quotidian. <br><br><b>Freedom Song</b> is the work of a writer--published here for the first time in the United States--possessed of an extraordinary gift.</p><p>Amit Chaudhuri's first book to be published in the United States comprises three short novels and is a masterpiece of the telling detail--in one paragraph he accomplishes what might take other writers entire volumes. Consider, for example, this description of family life in "A Strange and Sublime Address": <blockquote> Monday morning came like a fever. Chhotomama would be at the dining-table, eating a rapid meal of dal, fish, and rice, trying to avoid chewing as much of it as possible before he rushed to work. Then he would rush upstairs where a pair of polished black shoes would be waiting for him like a long-promised gift. He would spend five minutes persuading his feet to enter the shoes, or the shoes to swallow his feet.... Over and over again he would shout "I'm late!" in the classic manner of the man crying "Fire!" or "Timber!" or "Eureka!" while Saraswati and Mamima scuttled around him like frightened birds. </blockquote> The plot of "A Strange and Sublime Address" is slight--a young boy spends his summer with relatives in Calcutta--and consists mainly of a series of episodes strung together. But the characters are so lovingly limned and the places so intimately described that not even a one-way ticket to India could rival Chaudhuri's rendering. <p> He works similar magic on Oxford and Bombay in the second novel, "Afternoon Raag." Again, the story is almost inconsequential: a young Indian student at Oxford must choose between two women. What's <i>really</i> important here, however, are the character's memories of his music teacher back in Bombay; his mother's morning rituals; his father clipping his fingernails onto an old copy of <i>The Times of India</i>. Likewise, in the third novel, "Freedom Song," plot takes a back seat to the delicate workings of familial relationships as two clans attempt to marry off a "problem" relative. What makes these three short novels so satisfying is the fact that the author's remarkable sensibility is more than matched by his literary skillfulness. For readers in love with language, <i>Freedom Song</i> is the answer to a prayer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"I don't recall being so overwhelmed by a new, for me, prose writer since I picked up Laurence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet so many years ago.

He is a former professional Ironman triathlete and two-time Canadian 50 km ultra-marathon champion. Born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Brendan lives in California.<b>PREFACE TO THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION </b><br><br>When the first edition of <i>The Thrive Diet</i> was published 10 years ago, my hope for it far exceeded my expectation. After all, my belief in how plant-based nutrition could boost athletic performance while also reducing the strain on the environment was, at the time, considered fringe at best. A national bestselling book in North America, <i>The Thrive Diet</i> has since been published in several countries, benefiting the lives of millions of people. It&#x2019;s been a rewarding journey, sharing the principles of <i>The Thrive Diet </i>and the benefits of plant-based nutrition, whether I&#x2019;m talking at conferences, universities, or companies or simply having a conversation with people interested in learning more about or adopting a plant-based diet. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ten years later, it&#x2019;s now common for people to speak of their &#x201c;plant-based diet.&#x201d; Even &#x201c;vegan&#x201d; is a familiar word, seen on the most conventional restaurants&#x2019; menus. The importance of avoiding animal products in our diet, whether for heath, physical and mental performance, environmental, ethical, or a combination of these reasons, is now well understood and widely accepted. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well, in the past decade a whole new generation, the millennials, has come of age. This socially conscious generation&#x2014;numbering over 80&nbsp;million in the United States alone (greater than one-quarter of the population)&#x2014;cares about themselves and their individual health, of course, but they also care deeply about the health of the planet and how their choices and actions affect others. They care about social issues and how their food choices can sway industry. They want to know where their food comes from, and at what cost. And &#x201c;cost&#x201d; to them isn&#x2019;t simply monetary. It extends to the environment. In other words, how much of each natural resource is expended to get nutrition? Land, water, fossil fuels, and carbon footprint are all part of the equation. I wrote about this extensively in my third book, <i>Whole Foods to Thrive</i>, when the topic was still somewhat new. But today, these are the questions people regularly ask, because cost and return is better understood. I believe this socially minded consumption will become of even greater value as time goes by. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Millennials are also the first generation who understand that a greater amount of something is not necessarily a better deal. They understand that volume, weight, or amount of calories is no longer a value proposition, and they ask informed questions such as, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the nutrient density?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the cost-to-nutrient ratio?&#x201d; They know that the value of food ought to be measured in nutrients contained in it, not in caloric &#x201c;value,&#x201d; and certainly not in weight or sheer size. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, benefit is now more appreciated than ever. Millennials are less likely to aspire to owning a car, a bike, or even a song. Instead, they use car-share services and communal bike systems, and they stream music as opposed to buying it. They don&#x2019;t want things per se; they simply want the benefit that things can provide. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This way of thinking is crossing over into millennials&#x2019; view of food as well. More than previous generations, they appreciate the outcome of mindful eating, and therefore base their eating decisions largely on functional result. Will the food give them more sustainable energy? Will it improve their fat metabolism, enhance their skin elasticity, boost their ability to concentrate, improve their sleep quality, and so on? They want answers to these questions before they decide what to&nbsp;eat. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe the Thrive Diet is more relevant now than ever before. Approaching eating as an opportunity to benefit oneself&#x2014;having a desired function and a purpose in mind for the meal or snack&#x2014;this is the new way. Food as a means of change and progress. Food and the way in which it&#x2019;s produced as a way to affect billions of lives, human, non-human, and the planet&#x2019;s. <br><br>In this 10th anniversary edition, I have left the main text of the original intact, as the principles of the Thrive Diet continue to hold true today. If you are new to the Thrive Diet, today you have access to so many nutrient-dense whole foods that are widely available in grocery stores. A lot has changed in 10 years, and it is definitely progress in the right direction for those embracing a healthier way of eating. I&#x2019;ve created 25&nbsp; new Thrive Diet recipes for this edition that I hope you&nbsp;enjoy.</p><h2>Visiting Hours</h2><p>The first book of poetry published by internationally renowned spoken word performer, Shane Koyczan. Voted to *Best Books of 2005* lists in the Guardian (UK) and Globe and Mail newspapers.</p><p>Shane Koyczan is one of the world s premier spoken word artists. Born in Yellowknife, Koyczan spent much of his youth in Penticton, BC, where he attended Okanagan University College before moving to Vancouver. Shane beginnings in slam poetry came out of pure necessity. He was wondering how he was going to pay a phone bill when he saw a poster on a streetlamp in Vancouver offering prize money for a poetry slam. Shane entered that slam and won the event. He paid that bill and enjoyed the experienced so much that he went on to win the 2000 US National Independent Poetry Slam in Rhode Isalnd. Shane captained the Vancouver team that won the Canadian nationals 2004. Shane is the first poet from outside the USA to win the prestigious US National Independent Poetry Slam. His 2005 book of poems, Visiting Hours, was hailed as a Book of the Year Selection by The Guardian (UK) and the Globe and Mail (Canada). Shane has performed to full houses around the world. He s rocked the stage at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Calgary s WordFest and lit up the Vancouver International Writers Festival twice. Shane toured New Zealand and Australia in the Spring of 2007 where he performed to standing ovations and sold out bookstores. He s toured Canada and USA extensively.My band -- The Rheostatics-- toured BC this past October. Months before, I was driving the Crown Vic through the stupid rain when I heard a poem on Nora Young s radio show, The Future: a weird love poem to Britney spears incanted by a writer identified as Shane Corson. Having clearly underestimated the extended talents of the scrappy ex-Maple Leaf winger, I googled his published work, only to discover that Nora had said Koyczan, not Corson (the Shane (sic) part I got right). I corresponded with Koyczan, and then, in the fall, he opened our Western shows. A big Kelvinator of a man who loves women and free food, Shane swallowed the stage with the power of his verse, stepping from subdued deep hot sad love poetry to hip-hop power chord meta-meter, throttling the crowd with the weight of his rhymes, and effectively wiping the stage with us. While on tour we received copies of his first book, Visiting Hours...which is all that Shane is live, as fast and cool, and now as thrillingly rich and moving. And so, a whole new generation of rhyme readers will be born. --David Bidini in the Globe and Mail, December 31, 2005.<br><br>I found Visiting Hours in a lovely little bookstore in Toronto. I picked it up and straight away was hooked. He has the ability to take you straight into the heart of what on the surface may seem like mundane actions but which turn out to be much more complex. He makes you feel the depth of love, joy and pain in everyday life. Love, after all, is in everything. --Joel Pott, The Guardian<br><br>There'll be comparisons aplenty - Gary Snyder, Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, Paul Durcan, John Cooper Clarke - but Koyczan is staking out his own literary acreage. Koyczan employs a mysterious light touch to rip open your ribcage. Allow it. --Colum McCann, author of Dancer, This Side of Brightness, and his latest, Zoli</p><h2>Godshaper (1)</h2><p>Ennay is a man without a god. Bud is a god without a human. Together, they might just survive.<br><br>In 1958, the laws of physics stopped working: ignition, electricity, and combustion. But an alternative was provided, and people&nbsp;found themselves each accompanied by their own personal god, the new fuel and currency of the world. Varying in shape, size, and influence, these companion deities changed everything.<br> <br> Ennay, however, was born without a god and he&#x2019;s not alone. Men and women like him are Godshapers, godless but with the ability to mold and shape the gods of others. Paired with Bud, a friendly god without a human, he goes&nbsp;on the road looking for food, shelter, and a paying gig. Despite their efforts to keep a low profile, Ennay and Bud stumble upon a mystery that will have lasting ramifications for god and man alike.<br> <br> Written by visionary author Simon Spurrier (<i>The Spire, X-Men Legacy</i>) and illustrated by breakout talent Jonas Goonface, <i>Godshaper</i> introduces a vast world teeming with bold ideas exploring ownership, freedom, and the pettiness of possession&#x2014;both physical and spiritual.</p><p>Simon Spurrier is a British comic writer who began his career in comics with 2000 AD and Warhammer Monthly.

Over the years they have gained a notable following of ill-taught people who are being convinced that this is the one true church, and that it was actually founded by the Lord Jesus Christ on the day of Pentecost. In order to prove their points of doctrine, they use the most chopped-up portions of mismatched and ill-chosen verses imaginable. About three-fourths of their proof texts do not even relate to the subject at hand. This book is a helpful tool for soul winners who would convert these dear, lost people.</p><p></p><h2>Cold As The Grave</h2><p>The ninth book in the Sunday Times -bestselling phenomenon that is the Inspector McLean series, from one of Scotland&#39;s most celebrated crime writers . Her lifeless body is hidden in the dark corner of a basement room, a room which seems to have been left untouched for decades. A room which feels as cold as the grave. As a rowdy demonstration makes its slow and vocal way along Edinburgh&#39;s Royal Mile, Detective Chief Inspector Tony McLean&#39;s team are on stand-by for any trouble. The newly promoted McLean is distracted, inexplicably drawn to a dead-end mews street... and a door, slightly ajar, which leads to this poor girl&#39;s final resting place. But how long has she been there, in her sleep of death? The answers are far from what McLean or anyone else could expect. The truth far more chilling than a simple cold case...

Carrie&#x2019;s husband, Jared, claims his wife has always been unstable and that she has abandoned the family, but Linda doesn&#x2019;t trust him.

But Linda has become obsessed with Carrie&#x2019;s fate, and with the well-being of her vulnerable young daughter. She cannot let the matter rest until she finds out the truth. Is she wrong to go against her husband, the bishop, when her inner convictions are so strong?<br><br>Inspired by a chilling true crime and written by a practicing Mormon, <i>The Bishop&#x2019;s Wife</i> is both a fascinating look at the lives of modern Mormons as well as a grim and cunningly twisted mystery.</p><p>Mette Ivie Harrison is the author of three other novels in the Linda Wallheim mystery series, <i>His Right Hand</i>, <i>For Time and All Eternities</i>, and <i>Not of This Fold</i>, as well as numerous books for young adults.

I was used to being looked past, because I was never the person that they were there to see. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning at the six thirty doorbell, I shook Kurt. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be wanting the bishop,&#x201d; I said. I was already out of bed and putting on my robe. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can, Linda,&#x201d; he said sleepily. He hadn&#x2019;t been to bed before midnight last night, I was sure. I hurried downstairs, sure that something terrible had happened. It was late January in Draper, Utah, and as picturesque as the snow on the mountains was, it did not mix well with our modern lifestyle. My fear as I stood hesitating at the door was that someone was here to tell us that a teenager from the ward had skidded off the road and was on his way to the hospital. The doorbell rang again, and then the door was knocked on, impatiently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally opened the door, I saw Jared Helm, one of the newer members of the ward, carrying his five-year-old daughter, Kelly. She had curly blonde hair that always seemed messy, no matter how often it was combed. The remains of breakfast (oatmeal) were all over her chin. She was still in her pajamas, but she&#x2019;d been bundled into an inside-out snowsuit. How her father had figured out how to get the zipper up without putting it on the right way around, I didn&#x2019;t know.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can I see Bishop Wallheim?&#x201d; asked Jared.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not an accident, then, I thought with relief. &#x201c;Come in from the cold. He&#x2019;s awake, and he&#x2019;ll be down in a minute,&#x201d; I assured Jared. So would Samuel, the youngest of my five sons, who was a senior in high school; I could hear his alarm going off upstairs and knew he&#x2019;d be rushing out the door soon. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I led Jared and Kelly to the front room, where my neglected piano waited for me to practice. Mostly, the room was used now for people waiting to go into Kurt&#x2019;s office. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jared Helm looked terribly strained, though he was well-kempt. His hair was darker than his daughter&#x2019;s, but it was clear where she got the messy mop. His was wet now, the curls ruthlessly combed around a side part. He was dressed in a button-down striped shirt, cable sweater, and neatly pressed khakis. I wondered if his wife did that pressing or if he did it himself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished I knew the Helms better, but I had only a general impression that he and his wife were unhappy, although devoted parents to Kelly, and that they were struggling financially, as a lot of people in the ward were currently. Maybe he was here because he was in money trouble? Kurt could send him to the bishop&#x2019;s storehouse for some basic food supplies, but many people were unwilling to take that kind of help. The stigma wasn&#x2019;t insignificant. More often, people wanted Kurt to write them a check. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got out a toy for Kelly to play with, but she held it limply in her hands, uninterested. They were all trucks and building toys, things my sons had enjoyed. I&#x2019;d never had a chance to build a collection of toys for girls, though I sometimes imagined what I would have bought for a daughter. Dolls? Faux cooking supplies and a tiny stove? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a picture book and read it quietly to her, but after several pages I put it down. Kelly&#x2019;s eyes were wandering all over the room. I finally sat her on my lap and let her plunk on the piano keys, which she seemed to enjoy. None of my boys had been interested at this age, except for Samuel. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after a few minutes, Kelly&#x2019;s piano playing earned the attention of her father, who had been staring silently at his lap. &#x201c;Stop that noise,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;You know how to behave better than that.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t seem to see me at all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little girl immediately went still and folded her hands together. The moment Jared looked away, Kelly slipped her thumb into her mouth, her eyes intent on her father, and I had the sense that she would be in trouble if he caught her doing that, too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved slightly to the side, protecting Kelly from her father&#x2019;s critical gaze with my body, and I thought, as I so often did, about the daughter I had lost. Too often, I knew I judged other parents for not treating a daughter as I imagined I would have treated mine, had she lived. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear Kurt&#x2019;s feet thumping on the floor of the bathroom. He was out of the shower. &#x201c;The bishop will be down in just a minute, I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; I said again to Jared. It wouldn&#x2019;t take Kurt long to dress. He had become quite efficient at putting on his daily suit. He didn&#x2019;t used to wear one to work every day, but since he became bishop last year, it had seemed that there was no time when he could wear casual clothes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel rushed past Jared Helm and out the front door, hair still wet, a piece of bread between his teeth. &#x201c;Love you, Mom,&#x201d; he mumbled as he headed out to the bus stop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Love you,&#x201d; I said, still seated with Kelly on my lap. I gave up on the hope of giving my son a hug and kiss goodbye this morning. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly unwelcoming if I was waiting by the door and it was easy for him to stoop over me, but he wouldn&#x2019;t kiss or hug me back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Samuel had gone, I noticed that Jared was wiping tears from his eyes. He was in distress, that much was obvious. Where was his wife? If this was a financial problem, as I had first thought, why weren&#x2019;t they here together? I had seen Carrie Helm last Sunday at church and she had been sitting a clear distance from her husband, with Kelly between them. It had been obvious that they were in the midst of an argument, but I hadn&#x2019;t thought much of it at the time. Married couples fight. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrie Helm was one of the voices I most enjoyed in Relief Society, the church women&#x2019;s group. Carrie was intelligent and she wasn&#x2019;t afraid of saying something that might sound controversial. She was earnest about what she said, too, and didn&#x2019;t do it purely for the sake of causing a stir. But I&#x2019;d always had the feeling her husband&#x2019;s viewpoints were more conservative than hers, and had wondered how that affected their marriage. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week in Sunday School, with Jared sitting beside her, Carrie had made a comment about the priesthood not belonging to men, but rather being God&#x2019;s power that men had access to. Jared&#x2019;s expression was livid. He&#x2019;d leaned over and whispered something to her, and after that, I saw her flinch when he tried to touch her. Four days later, and apparently Jared Helm had still not apologized to her sufficiently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now he sat here crying silently in the hall at 6:50 on a Thursday morning. &#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I can get you something to eat.&#x201d; Food is the first thing we Mormons tend to offer. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn&#x2019;t, but the offer is a way of showing concern, at least.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; said Jared, clearing his throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x201d; said Kelly, taking her thumb out of her mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to eat again. I already fed you breakfast at home.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly looked at her thumb and said nothing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Growing children are always hungry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind fixing her something. It will make me feel useful.&#x201d; I put Kelly down, covering up the hand with the damp thumb as I led her into the kitchen. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Behave yourself, Kelly,&#x201d; said Jared.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was always like this with her or if he was simply overly anxious about being in someone else&#x2019;s home. I hoped it was the latter, and I could show him that I didn&#x2019;t mind the trouble. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the kitchen, I set Kelly on a stool by the counter and set out six separate jams for her to choose from as I made toast. A few minutes later, I heard Kurt come downstairs. He spoke briefly to Jared in the front room, then invited him into his office. I breathed relief and focused my attention on Kelly. After she had chosen a separate jam for each slice of toast and worked through three full pieces, the little girl drank a glass of milk and burped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you too hot? Maybe I could help you get that snowsuit off,&#x201d; I offered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Daddy put it on wrong,&#x201d; said Kelly, glancing in the direction her father had gone, as if she wanted to make sure he couldn&#x2019;t hear her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; I said, fighting a smile.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mommy never puts it on wrong, but Daddy always does.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at the echo of Carrie&#x2019;s spunky attitude. &#x201c;Daddies are sometimes good at other things,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know. But Daddy says Mommy is bad,&#x201d; said Kelly. Her lips quivered. &#x201c;He says that I shouldn&#x2019;t want her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But all little girls want their mothers,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Of course they do.&#x201d; Was Kelly telling me that her mother had left them? I supposed this was the answer to the question of why Jared was here. Poor Jared. Poor Carrie. But most of all, poor Kelly. The children were the ones who always suffered the most when parents had problems. &#x201c;Your daddy loves you very much,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly put her hands to her hair. &#x201c;He forgot to brush me,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s deal with that right now,&#x201d; I said, and led Kelly to the upstairs bathroom. I didn&#x2019;t have any ribbons or hair elastics suitable for a young girl, but I used what I could. In the end, the hair was well brushed, and I had a few tiny braids in it that were holding. By the time her father came out of Kurt&#x2019;s office downstairs, Kelly was giggling and making faces at herself in the mirror. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then Jared called for his daughter and Kelly tensed, all the happiness erased from her face. Just like her mother at church last week. What was going on here? I&#x2019;d thought it was simply a case of an unhappy marriage, but was it more serious than that? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have to obey Daddy,&#x201d; said Kelly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, and led her downstairs to her father&#x2019;s arms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jared didn&#x2019;t say a word to her or to me, simply took his daughter and left.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurt closed the door behind them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can you tell me anything?&#x201d; I asked. Most of the secrets Kurt found out were to be held in confidence, but there isn&#x2019;t the same kind of strictness in a Mormon bishop&#x2019;s counseling session as there is with Catholic confession.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurt shrugged. &#x201c;It will come out soon enough. Carrie has left him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Last night? Did they have an argument? Why he didn&#x2019;t come then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Apparently she left him in the night. He woke up and found her gone. She left a note saying she wasn&#x2019;t coming back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised she left Kelly,&#x201d; I said. I was more than surprised. I was in knots about it. A mother leaving a child, it was&#x2014;unfathomable to me. What pain had she been in? What had she been thinking? It was one thing to file for divorce and to ask your husband to leave the house. Or even to take your daughter and find an apartment. To leave her behind, and in the middle of the night without a proper goodbye . . . I shivered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to know what goes on in the mind of a woman,&#x201d; said Kurt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hated when Kurt said things like that. &#x201c;It is not that hard. Women are just as sensible as men,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you understand what their lives are like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then how could she leave her daughter? I never would have thought it of Carrie Helm, of all people. She loved that little girl so much.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, she had. She had always walked Kelly to Primary and made sure she had a big hug. &#x201c;She might not have felt she had any choice.&#x201d; It was the only answer I could think of. Kurt, as bishop, was the one who should know more of the inner workings of their relationship than I did. But then again, Carrie and Jared had never come to see him together, so now all he would have was Jared&#x2019;s side of the story. Jared had a calling as an instructor in the elders quorum and fulfilled it faithfully every month. As far as Kurt was concerned, he was the one who was reliable and trustworthy. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I asked him if there was any hope they might still reconcile. I wish they had come to see me earlier. I might have been able to help.&#x201d; He looked toward the kitchen, the smell of toast and jam drawing him, and we moved in that direction. I put new toast in the toaster and he got out a plate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with his big appetite, Kurt had enormous faith in the power of prayer. He thought any marriage could be saved with enough work and help from God. I am sad to say I am not as believing. Some marriages aren&#x2019;t meant to last, and it was quite possible that Jared and Carrie Helm&#x2019;s was one of these. They did not seem like a particularly good match. There were marriages that worked despite disparities in character, but not many.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He said she was very final about it. She said she was never coming back. He thinks there may be another man involved.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; I said. If Carrie Helm had realized how mismatched she and Jared were, and she&#x2019;d found someone who was less of a mismatch&#x2014;well, it almost explained things. It was selfish, but people are sometimes selfish. Sometimes even mothers.

He still has debilitating panic attacks, but he needs to refuel his creative drive. He moves to the countryside, where an elderly neighbor befriends him. In the wake of an unpleasant encounter with another neighbor, who objects to Marc's trespassing cat, Marc meets Emily, an attractive veterinarian, and starts an affair with her. When Marc visits his parents, his father reveals that he is refusing treatment for Alzheimer's. Marc launches a pet project, for which he has already obtained a place in a gallery exhibition, of photographing workers at the shipyard from which his father retired. Brother George, his wife, and their baby visit. The first prints in the project dismay Marc, and he starts over. He and Emily scrap and decide to look for a place together. Several developments resolve by book's end; meanwhile, Larcenet realizes Marc's world in a wealth of particulars--Marc and George's brotherly routines, the elderly friend's link to Marc's father, the obnoxious photographer who is the star of the exhibition, and many more. The combination of cartoony but individualized characters and backdrops ranging from blank spaces to near-photographic outdoor settings, and the division of major narrative sections with single-page, bichromatic montages of photorealistic portraits and interior details heighten the sense that this is a genuine and consequential graphic <i>novel</i>. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

This book is a charming series of 50 articles written for Reminisce magazine. These articles each cover a topic from sometime between the 1930s to the 1960s. Mr. Strock covers seemingly every relatable topic from what it was like being a kid during the depression, what Chirstmas and Halloween was like many years ago, the difficulty of finding a house after returning from World War II, etc.. Being a younger person (24), I did not think I would enjoy this book too much; I expected it to be long and boring. I expected it to be nothing more than a bunch of stories beginning with &#34;Back when I was a kid..&#34; However, each story seems to have its own charm. Mr. Strock brought to light was life was like 60 years ago to someone like me who does not know. The book is written in such a way that even someone as young as me can feel and understand the thrills and pains of life many years ago, as I read each short story.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Poems of Christina Rossetti: A Variorum Edition: Volume I</h2><p><p>Christina Rossetti is known as the greatest female poet of the Victorian age. By the time of her death in 1898 she had written eleven hundred poems and had published over nine hundred of them. Scholars have long felt the need for a complete collection of her work, yet, until now, there has been none. In this projected three-volume set, R.W. Crump will present all of Rossetti&#x2019;s known poetry.</p><p>Crump gives the reader a remarkably comprehensive text with notes revealing Rossetti&#x2019;s process of composition and revision and her painstaking concern for the technical details of her work. The variant readings in the notes are taken from extant manuscripts, individual poems as published or privately printed before being incorporated into her published collections, and all the English and American editions of her poems through William Michael Rossetti&#x2019;s <i>The Poetical Works of Christina Georgina Rossetti </i>(1904). A special feature of this variorum edition is its list of holographs and their locations.</p><p> In the first volume Crump brings together Rossetti&#x2019;s two earliest published collections; in the second will be the individually published poems; and in the third, the unpublished poems.</p></p><p>The printing history of &#39;Goblin Market&#39; and &#39;The Prince&#39;s Progress&#39; during Christina&#39;s lifetime is critical to the determination of the text of this volume.R.W.

A reckless young mouse named Ralph makes friends with a boy in room 215 of the Mountain View Inn and discovers the joys of motorcycling.</p><p>"Pb-pb-b-b-b. Pb-pb-b-b-b." With these magic vocables, Ralph the mouse revs up a dream come true--his very own motorcycle. Living in a knothole in a hotel room, young Ralph has seen plenty of families come and go, some more generous with their crumbs than others. But when young Keith and his parents check in to the hotel, Ralph gets his first chance to check out. He has always fantasized about venturing beyond the second floor, maybe even outside. Curiosity overcomes caution, and Ralph must have a go at Keith's toy motorcycle. Soon, the headstrong mouse finds himself in a pickle, when all he wanted was to ride a motorcycle. Lucky for him, the boy understands how it is. When he discovers Ralph in his thwarted attempt to abscond with the toy bike, Keith generously encourages the rodent to ride. He even teaches him the simple trick of starting the motorcycle: "You have to make a noise... pb-pb-b-b-b." The subsequent situations Ralph motors into require quick thinking and grownup-sized courage. The team of Beverly Cleary and Louis Darling has been a great favorite for decades, introducing young chapter readers to Ramona, Beezus, Henry, and of course Ralph the mouse. (Ages 8 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i><p>Ralph the mouse craves excitement, but it seldom comes along to his mousehole in the sleepy Mountain View Inn. That all changes when a boy named Keith comes to the inn with his family.

The book tracks the evolution of the power amassed by a tiny group of men who have regarded themselves, quite literally, as gods-the Gods of Money. Their agenda has included assassinations of two of America&#39;s most popular presidents; involvement of the United States against the public will in two world wars; and detonation of the world&#39;s most destructive weapon, the atomic bomb, on Japanese civilians. It has included scores of regional wars, political assassinations, coups, and systematic corruption of the body politic. The book reveals how this powerful elite has systematically set out to literally control the entire world, backed by the most powerful military force the world has ever seen.</p><p>Ellen Brown has applied her training as a litigating attorney, researcher and writer to the monetary field, unearthing facts that even the majority of banking and financial experts ignore: ranging from the privatization of money creation, to the Plunge Protection Team, to the Federal Reserve's "Helicopter Money."

Sixteen hundred seventy-six was a cataclysmic year of Indian insurrection and civil war in America, when the colonies lost their &#34;autonomy&#34; after King Philip&#39;s War and Bacon&#39;s Rebellion. Stephen Webb makes clear how the forces unleashed in 1676 revolutionized the relationships between the adolescent colonies, the imperial government in London, and the embattled Algonquin and Iroquois Indians, and shows how the political institutions that evolved in the colonies in the next three hundred years reflected this experience.Webb argues here that the hardships of nature, the Indian insurrection, and wars reduced the independent Colonies into English provinces. To make his case, "Webb presents events from the perspectives of the colonists, Whitehall, and the American Indians . . . . This detailed provocative account . . . is bound to stir lively discussion" (LJ 5/15/84).<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mummies, Myth, and Magic: Religion in Ancient Egypt (Lucent Library of Historical Eras)</h2><p>Next to the famous pyramids, Egypt is perhaps most famous for its rich and complex body of religious beliefs, customs and practices.

The cabin's lone inhabitant was a former mathematics prodigy and wunderkind professor who had abandoned society decades earlier. Few people knew his name, Theodore Kaczynski, but everyone knew the mayhem and death associated with his nickname: the Unabomber.</p><p>For two decades, Kaczynski had masterminded a campaign of random terror, killing and maiming innocent people through bombs sent in untraceable packages. The FBI task force charged with finding the perpetrator of these horrifying crimes grew to 150 people, yet his identity remained a maddening mystery. Then, in 1995, a "manifesto" from the Unabomber was published in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em>, resulting in a cascade of tips--including the one that cracked the case.</p><p>With access to new primary sources and exclusive interviews with key law enforcement officials,<em> New York Times</em> bestselling author and former federal prosecutor Lis Wiehl meticulously reconstructs the white-knuckle, tension-filled hunt to identify and capture the mysterious killer.

As much as one wants to give Acker the benefit of a fair reading, it's hard not to be bored by the lengthy repetitions, the obscure plotlines, the complete disregard (deliberate, of course) for conventional notions of time. In The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, the fictional ``I'' decides to become various murderesses from history, as well as Yeats and Sade. Speaking in a cacophony of voices, she ``can't handle her own horniness,'' though ``sexual ecstasies become mystic communion.'' I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac, another historical hallucination, further emphasizes Acker's sense of the self in disintegration--the reason one assumes the roles of so many other characters from history and literature. Here, a story of sexual obsession somehow transforms into a bland litany of case histories of prisoners whose rights have been abused. This political dimension to Acker's porno-anarcho prose becomes most explicit in The Adult Life of Toulouse-Lautrec, which begins by imagining the artist as a sex-starved, deformed woman. A murder plot sort of develops, to be solved by Hercule Poirot; van Gogh's daughter is actually Janis Joplin, who becomes the lover of James Dean. A profile of Henry Kissinger illustrates how society is corrupted, and individuals like Toulouse-Lautrec/Joplin/Dean suffer. A long political speech, full of half-digested left-wing notions, demonstrates America's decline into ``friendly fascism.'' All of which leads to the facile equation, dramatized in the last section, that the CIA and the Mob are like-minded institutions of repression. The sexual details of Henry Miller, the numbing prose cutups of William Burroughs, the relentless assault on the senses of thrash music--to point out the excess of Acker's entire enterprise only serves her sense of striking out against the bourgeoisie. But it is possible to understand exactly what she's trying to do, and still find it a worthless exercise. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Ernie also made a keynote speech about&nbsp;<b><i>The Joy of Not Working</i>&nbsp;</b>to 1,200 career experts at the National Career Development Association convention in&nbsp;Orlando,&nbsp;Florida in June 2017.An odd mix of amateur psychology and self-help is offered by this engineer happily and creatively unemployed for 14 years. His clear-as-a-bell message is that making the most of leisure involves knowing yourself inside and outside of work. And that, for most overworked and undersatisfied Americans, amounts to an overwhelming task. To some extent, Zelinski tames the process with a combination of humor, cartoons, quotes from the famous (and the not so), fan mail excerpts, and a host of exercises to try. Explored in depth are the nature of boredom (complaining is one sure sign), the value of work, inner passions and goals, and the potential maleficence of money. None of these thoughts are new; Abraham Maslow, for one, advocated the stages toward healthy humanity. Nor are the statistics, remarks, or observations unique. But the notion of how to enjoy free time is finally geared to a mass market. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Mathieu Matï¿½got (English and French Edition)</h2><p>Mathieu Matï¿½got was a leading French designer of the 1950s.

Posters came into existence just decades before the inception of film, and as movies became a universal medium of entertainment, posters likewise became a ubiquitous form of advertising. At first, movie posters suggested a film&#x2019;s theme, from adventure and romance to thrills and spine-tingling horror. Then, with the ascendancy of the film star, posters began to sell icons and lifestyles, nowhere more so than in Hollywood. But every country producing films used posters to sell their product.</p><p><em>Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster</em> charts the history of the movie poster from both a creative and a commercial perspective. It includes sections focusing on poster artists, the development of styles, the influence of politics and ideology, and how commerce played a role in the film poster&#x2019;s development.

Theodore Levin evokes the spectacular physical and human geography of the area and weaves a rich ethnography of the life styles, values, and art of the musical performers. Photographs, maps, and an accompanying CD (featuring 24 on-site recordings) make The Hundred Thousand Fools of God a unique reading and listening experience.</p></p><p>When a Princeton-trained ethnomusicologist returns to follow up his studies in the Central Asian nations east of China and north of Afghanistan, he stumbles into a cornucopia of music, history, and religion. With a trusty guide called OM, Theodore Levin travels back and forth through the newly liberated cities and countryside of an ancient land that is home to such exotic names as Tashkent and Samarkand. Levin writes not only about his successes in identifying and recording the musical traditions of the area but also of the experiences of the people under Soviet rule, the myths that are kept alive through music, and the healers that use music as therapy. Levin finds a complex and colorful mix of ethnic and religious traditions where music unites Jew, Muslim, and shaman. <i>The Hundred Thousand Fools of God</i> is more than just a travel diary: it is a snapshot of an evolving culture. And the accompanying CD is divine. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>This book opens a window onto the cultural and political history of Central Asia in tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet times.

It is a slender volume on which to found a reputation, and yet his reputation is secure: the scripts in his book can bear comparison to the work of any professional scribe of the sixteenth century. Canteo&#39;s specimens possess unmistakable superiority as examples of formal calligraphy. Joseph Conrad inadvertently provided a good touchstone for manuscripts of this class when he wrote &#39;A work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line.&#39;Cataneo&#39;s copybook is surely humbled: indeed, compared with the posturing and self-advertisement of some of his contemporary scribes, he seems humility&#39;s essence. His book is just as surely a work of art, the proof of which is to be found in every line.</p><p></p><h2>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained</h2><p>Omar Khayyam&#39;s famous poem, The Rubaiyat, is loved by Westerners as a hymn of praise to sensual delights. In the East it is known as a deep allegory of the soul&#39;s romance with God. As for what his quatrains actually mean, most of them have remained a mystery in the East as much as in the West. Now after eight centuries, Paramhansa Yogananda, one of the great mystics of our times, a master of yoga and the author of the classic Autobiography of a Yogi, explains the mystery behind Omar&#39;s famous poem. This book contains the essence of great revelation.</p><p>This audio book lets the user enjoy some of the most evocative and spiritually insightful verses ever written. Yogananda&#39;s allegorical explanations of Omar Khayyam&#39;s famous poem will awaken and inspire all listeners to the deep spiritual truths behind this literary classic. Long regarded as a famous love poem that celebrates the senses, &#34;The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained &#34; spells out the poems allegory for the spiritual path-well known in the east, now made clear for the Western audience. Omar Khayyam was a deep mystic, not a hedonist, and his poem is a mystical allegory of the soul&#39;s romance with God. Listen to the melodic voice of J. Donald Walters as he sings and chants each verse of &#34;The Rubaiyat&#34;, reads the poetic paraphrase of each passage, then follows with a clarifying, expanded meaning.In Persia, Omar Khayyam has always been recognized as a highly advanced mystic and spiritual teacher. His rubaiyat have been revered as an inspired Sufi scripture. &#34;The first great Sufi writer was Omar Khayyam,&#34; writes Professor Charles F. Horne in the Introduction to the Rubaiyat, which appears in Vol. VIII of &#34;The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East&#34; series. (Parke, Austin and Lipscomb, London, 1917.) &#34;Unfortunately,&#34; he continues, &#34;Omar, by a very large number of Western readers, has come to be regarded as a rather erotic pagan poet, a drunkard interested only in wine and earthly pleasure. This is typical of the confusion that exists on the entire subject of Sufism. The West has insisted on judging Omar from its own viewpoint.

Now, in a world designed using CAD programs, Kapoor argues that the next logical step in integrating design with production is to move from virtual models to 3D-printed buildings. In <i>Unconformity and Entropy</i>, a number of finished architectural works are fleshed out with preparatory studies and extracts from the artist's extensive technical research, illustrating his investigation of the fluid and plastic qualities of cement. Central to the project is the conceit of the use of a purpose-built machine to generate forms through which Kapoor would explore the intersection of idea and event. Extensively illustrated with original drawings, sketches and color photographs, and superbly designed, <i>Unconformity and Entropy</i> also includes several illuminating introductory essays.</p><p>Anish Kapoor was born in Bombay, but has lived and worked in London since the 1970s when he moved to study art, first at the Hornsey College of Art and later at the Chelsea School of Art and Design.

The story, however, is less concerned with the rights and wrongs of left and right than with an absence of integrity at the very heart of the debate. Certainly the hero, John Laskell, staging a slow recovery from the death of his lover and a near-fatal illness of his own, comes to suspect that the conflicts and commitments involved are little more than a distraction from the real responsibilities, and terrors, of the common world.<br><br>A detailed, sometimes slyly humorous, picture of the manners and mores of the intelligentsia, as well as a work of surprising tenderness and ultimately tragic import, <i>The Middle of the Journey</i> is a novel of ideas whose quiet resonance has only grown with time. This is a deeply troubling examination of America by one of its greatest critics.</p><p>Lionel Trilling (1905-1975) was an American literary critic, author, and University Professor at Columbia University.

This engrossing book is the first full-length biography of Walter in English. Born in Berlin, Walter began his long and eventful career in provincial theaters; his successes there led to positions at the premier opera houses of Berlin and Vienna. Then for a decade he served as Bavarian music director, conducting opera in three theaters and giving symphonic concerts. <p>Erik Ryding and Rebecca Pechefsky tell of Walter&#x2019;s close friendship with Gustav Mahler, his relations with Thomas Mann and his family, and his romantic involvement with the soprano Delia Reinhardt. Ousted from Germany by the Nazi Party in 1933, he returned to Vienna, where he was artistic director of the State Opera until the Nazis again forced him out. He eventually emigrated to the United States, where he led the New York Philharmonic and other orchestras, developed a deep interest in the writings of Rudolf Steiner, and made touchstone recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra.</p></p><p>Erik Ryding is the managing editor of publications at Carnegie Hall. Rebecca Pechefsky is a freelance harpsichordist.Conductor, composer, pianist, and writer Bruno Walter (1876-1962) studied with Mahler and championed his music and that of Wagner in both opera house and concert hall. Starting in Germany and making his name in Vienna, he left for America in 1939 to escape the Nazis. He was musical adviser to the New York Philharmonic and conducted the Metropolitan Opera's orchestra and many others. He dismissed atonal music as unappealing to the emotions and embraced anthroposophy, which shunned materialism and concentrated on ethics and the soul. With only the slightest guidance concerning his own view of a composition and its composer's intentions, he let the musicians he directed make music. His three books, many essays, and especially his many recordings keep his reputation fresh. Drawing on his collected papers and letters, numerous interviews, and reviews of his concerts, Ryding and Pechefsky trace Walter through Europe and America. They illuminate the honorable and ethical man that he was as well as his interpretive approaches as one of the best-loved conductors of the twentieth century. <i>Alan Hirsch</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Immortalized by writers such as Shakespeare and prized by wine connoisseurs of the past, sherry was once considered to be an indispensable element of a well-stocked wine cellar, yet in modern times it has been largely ignored, to the point where it is sometimes forgotten that sherry is even a wine at all. Recent years, however, have seen a resurgent interest in sherry among wine consumers worldwide, particularly when it comes to top-quality dry versions, from fino and manzanilla to oloroso, amontillado or palo cortado.<br><br> In this authoritative guide, Peter Liem and Jesï¿½s Barquï¿½n present a detailed and thorough introduction to these inimitable wines. While they acknowledge sherry's historical significance and rich tradition, they focus on discussing sherry from a contemporary perspective, describing the vast array of sherry styles and examining the intricate methods of production and aging that shape the wine's character, as well as offering extensive profiles of sherry bodegas and producers. Also included is a chapter on Montilla, a closely-related Andalusian wine that demonstrates an identity all its own.<br><br> <i>Sherry, Manzanilla &amp; Montilla</i> is the first entirely new book on sherry to be published in the United States in over two decades, making it an indispensable resource for anyone seeking to learn more about this remarkable wine.<br><br><i>Shortlisted for International Wine Book of the Year 2013, Louis Roederer International Wine Writers Awards</i><br><br><i>Shortlisted for the 2012 Andrï¿½ Simon Food and Drink Book Awards</i></p><p><b>Peter Liem</b> is an American wine writer, and author of <i>ChampagneGuide.net</i>.

She's the daughter of April, a goddesslike earth mother, and December, her absentee father whom she sets out to meet. Along the way through the calendar, she meets many other relatives, who explain to her how the months have come to be in their present order, and why her parents, because of their totally opposite natures, "were put at opposite ends of the year." All of the characters--Uncle July, Grandmother November, Aunt February and her leonine son March--are true to their seasonal nature. May makes her way back to her mother in a kind of quest for identity and family roots. The story is both light and serious, given its mythic roots and the general silliness of the stereotypical characters. The pictures, swirling in meteorological effects and full of the symbols readers associate with each month, combine fantasy colors with earth and sky tones to provide a charming tale with unusual mythological resonance. --Ruth K. MacDonald, Quinnipiac College, Hamden, CT<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The merry young month of May, scattering blossoms, loses her way and wanders into June--her Aunt June, from whom May now learns of her father's existence. ``He lives off at the other end of the year somewhere....Very far and very cold.'' May sets out to visit him, helped on her way by other relatives/months. When she finds her father December, he lovingly welcomes her and relates how, before the months were in order, he and May's mother, April, fell in love and married; but the clash of their temperaments forced them to separate. Promising to visit often, May finds her way on to April with the help of the intervening months. Gerstein's super- kinetic paintings capture the seasons' differing lights, moods, and weathers. The personifications are amusing: November is a cozy fireside granny, February a rotund figure skater with sniffles, March a harlequin swooping in on a huge kite. An enjoyable (if predictable) journey, with special meaning for children of estranged parents. (Young reader/Picture book. 5-8.) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Liberating Our Dignity, Saving Our Souls is a study of African American identity aimed at pointing a way out of a current crisis into a new liberation and salvation. Butler combines insights and methodologies from developmental psychology, liberation theology, and African American history to plot a new course for contemporary African Americans to gain a sense of identity that will guide them away from the identity the European and American cultures have traditionally forced upon them. This involves determining identity by personal worth; not by occupation, economic class, or social class.</p><p>Lee H. Butler, Jr., Ph.D., is professor of theology and psychology at the Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS). He is founder of the Center for the Study of Black Faith and Life at CTS, president of the Society for the Study of Black Religion, past chairperson of the Committee on Race and Ethnicity in Theological Education (a standing committee of the Association of Theological Schools), and is a member of the Association of Black Psychologists, the Society for Pastoral Theology, and the American Academy of Religion.&#34;The synergism of diverse resources--black liberation theologies, psychodynamic psychologies, historical-cultural analyses, and religious-spiritual practices--launches Professor Butler&#39;s Liberating Our Dignity, Saving Our Souls. Butler is one of a growing cadre of African American pastoral psychologists whose work tackles the complex interplay between culture and identity. He shows how communal spirituality is for African Americans a liberated and soulful identity and not simply a means of coping with racism and genderism. This is a book about African American identity formation, yes, and also, because all human identities are forged in powerful cultural dynamics akin to those he describes, it is, indirectly, a book about us all.&#34;</p><h2>The Christ-Haunted Landscape: Faith and Doubt in Southern Fiction</h2><p><p>Here are Susan Ketchin's discerning interviews with twelve southerners living and writing in the South, and along with a piece of fiction by each are her penetrating commentaries about the impact of southern religious experience on their work.<br></p><p>A little more than a generation ago Flannery O'Connor made a startling observation about herself and her fellow southerners: "By and large," she said, "people in the South still conceive of humanity in theological terms.

The Southerner who isn't convinced of it is very much afraid that he may have been formed in the image and likeness of God."<br></p><p>Guided by O'Connor's perceptive commentary about southerners in general, Susan Ketchin has created a deeply revealing collection that mirrors the pervasive role of religion in the literature by the recent generation of notable southern writers.

Though Warren's fame, earned through his fiction and poetry, will attract readers, most of these essays do not reveal much about their author. They are best approached as introductory pieces on literature, especially on American classics. Warren makes the reader feel safe--almost too safe--in his hands: without undertaking many risks or surprises, he still succeeds in reviewing the key moral and psychological issues.

Hoxie, one of our most prominent and celebrated academic historians of Native American history, has for years asked his undergraduate students at the beginning of each semester to write down the names of three American Indians. Almost without exception, year after year, the names are Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. The general conclusion is inescapable: Most Americans instinctively view Indians as people of the past who occupy a position outside the central narrative of American history. These three individuals were warriors, men who fought violently against American expansion, lost, and died. It&#x2019;s taken as given that Native history has no particular relationship to what is conventionally presented as the story of America. Indians had a history too; but theirs was short and sad, and it ended a long time ago.&nbsp; <br><br>In <i>This Indian Country,</i> Hoxie has created a bold and sweeping counter-narrative to our conventional understanding. Native American history, he argues, is also a story of political activism, its victories hard-won in courts and campaigns rather than on the battlefield. For more than two hundred years, Indian activists&#x2014;some famous, many unknown beyond their own communities&#x2014;have sought to bridge the distance between indigenous cultures and the republican democracy of the United States through legal and political debate. Over time their struggle defined a new language of &#x201c;Indian rights&#x201d; and created a vision of American Indian identity. In the process, they entered a dialogue with other activist movements, from African American civil rights to women&#x2019;s rights and other progressive organizations. <br><br>Hoxie weaves a powerful narrative that connects the individual to the tribe, the tribe to the nation, and the nation to broader historical processes. He asks readers to think deeply about how a country based on the values of liberty and equality managed to adapt to the complex cultural and political demands of people who refused to be overrun or ignored. As we grapple with contemporary challenges to national institutions, from inside and outside our borders, and as we reflect on the array of shifting national and cultural identities across the globe, <i>This Indian Country</i> provides a context and a language for understanding our present dilemmas.</p><p><b>Frederick E. Hoxie</b> is the Swanlund Professor of History and a professor of law at the University of Illinois, where he specializes in Native American history. He is the author of several books, most recently T<i>alking Back to Civilization</i>. He served as the general editor of <i>The American Indians</i>, a twenty-three-volume series that has sold more than two million copies, and as the series editor (with Neal Salisbury) for <i>Cambridge Studies in American Indian History</i>. Professor Hoxie is a founding trustee of the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s National Museum of the American Indian and a former president of the American Society for Ethnohistory. He received his undergraduate degree from Amherst College and his Ph.D. from Brandeis University.Hoxie&#x2014;author, professor, and trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian&#x2014;focuses on Native American figures who, for the last 200 years, have sought to define a place for Native communities within the institutions of the U.S. He begins with James McDonald, the first Indian lawyer, who, in the 1820s, was the first Native activist to make the case for Indian rights directly to American political leaders. One of his successors, William Potter Ross, testified before Congress and was an active defender of American Indian nationalism until his death, in 1891. Sarah Winnemucca was a Paiute author and activist who wrote forcefully about the western expansion into her homeland. Hoxie examines in meticulous detail the successful 20-year Ojibwe struggle to stay on their land at Mille Lac, Minnesota, and the 1911 formation of the Society of American Indians, whose founders focused on the extension of American citizenship to all Native peoples. He concludes this enlightening volume, the latest in the Penguin History of American Life, with Vine Deloria, who encouraged &#x201c;re-tribalization&#x201d;&#x2014;the return of young educated Indians from cities back to their tribes. --Deborah Donovan</p><h2>Final Curtain</h2><p>A country house murder, artistic insight and the post-war reunion of Alleyn and Troy combine in Ngaio Marsh&#39;s wittiest and most readable novel. Agatha Troy, world famous portrait painter, is inveigled into accepting a commission to paint the 70-year-old Sir Henry Ancred, Bart., the Grand Old Man of the stage. But just as she has completed her portrait, the old actor dies. The dramatic circumstances of his death are such that Scotland Yard is called in -- in the person of Troy&#39;s long-absent husband, Chief Detective-Inspector Roderick Alleyn!</p><p>Dame Ngaio Marsh was born in New Zealand in 1895 and died in February 1982. She wrote over 30 detective novels and many of her stories have theatrical settings, for Ngaio Marsh&#39;s real passion was the theatre. She was both actress and producer and almost single-handedly revived the New Zealand public&#39;s interest in the theatre. It was for this work that she received what she called her `damery&#39; in 1966.Nadia May&#39;s British accent and soprano voice perfectly capture Marsh&#39;s narrative. Her portrayal of the bizarre cast of characters is superb. M.E.M.

Sir - I have said this before, and I say it again; the BBC has got to stop its PC assault on the game of men&#39;s rugby by using so many rugby-ignorant female commentators. We talk beef, not salad dressing. What else will the Telegraph&#39;s indefatigable, outraged, and above all very funny letter-writers fail to get the Letters Page to take seriously in 2010 - with the result that we have to collect their memorable missives in another book? Already there are enough fulminations on Chris Evans replacing Terry Wogan to fill an entire chapter. Gordon Brown&#39;s temper? Bankers&#39; bonuses? E-books?

The stories are peopled by characters as bizarre as they are unforgettable: Crazy Karchar, whose unpredictability requires an army of fleas to manage it; Kazan, who cheerfully pretends to necrophilia in order to escape from prison; the monster Goggle-eye; and the heroine Chichek, who shoots, races on horseback and wrestles her lover. Geoffrey Lewis&#39;s classic translation retains the odd and oddly appealing style of the stories, with their mixture of the colloquial, the poetic and the dignified, and magnificently conveys the way in which they bring to life a wild society and its inhabitants. This edition also includes an introduction, a map and explanatory notes.</p><p>Text: English, Turkish (translation)</p><h2>Backyard Chickens: The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Raising and Caring for Backyard Chickens (Homesteading Life)</h2><p><b>Are you considering raising backyard chickens?</b><br><br> If you are, then this is the book you've been looking for.

Though Stark quickly sheds his idealism, his right-hand man, Jack Burden -- who narrates the story -- retains it and proves to be a thorn in the new governor's side. Stark becomes a successful leader, but at a very high price, one that eventually costs him his life. The award-winning book is a play of politics, society and personal affairs, all wrapped in the cloak of history.Set in the &#39;30s, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel traces the rise and fall of demagogue Willie Stark, a fictional character who resembles the real-life Huey &#34;Kingfish&#34; Long of Louisiana. Stark begins his political career as an idealistic man of the people but soon becomes corrupted by success and caught between dreams of service and an insatiable lust for power. The model for 1996&#39;s best-selling novel, Primary Colors, and as relevant today as it was fifty years ago, All the King&#39;s Men is one of the classics of American literature.</p><h2>The Man Who Cried I Am</h2><p>Max Reddick, who is a talented &#39;black writer&#39; in America but a literary genius in Europe, is trying to come to terms with his dilemma. Max is tired of having to accept that being black will always be the primary definition of his life - despite his marriage to a white woman, despite his literary talent and aspirations, despite his intellectual and social relations, and despite his &#39;escape&#39; to the European cities of Paris and Amsterdam. At the end of his life, cut short by cancer, Max decides to question all the things that brought him to where he is today. John A. Williams has created in Max Reddick an unforgettable character: irascible, fiercely inteiligent, irredeemable, and honourable. The Man Who Cried I Am is a stunning chronicle of not only Williams&#39;s life but the lives of all black people who have refused to be victims: African-Americans who have had to leave their country to claim their individuality, intellectual independence, and rightful recognition, and who have always yearned to be &#39;home&#39; but struggled to find such a place. With penetrating fictional portraits of Richard Wright and James Baldwin, among other historical figures, John A Williams reveals the hope, courage, and bitter disappointment of the civil-rights era. Infused with powerful artistry, searing anger, as well as insight, humanity, and vision, The Man Who Cried I Am is a classic of post-war American literature.</p><p><b>John Tyerman Williams</b> is the author of <b>Pooh and the Millennium</b> and <b>Pooh and the Philosophers</b>.

And based on Brian Kellow&#x2019;s assessment in his thoroughly researched <i>Can I Go Now?</i> even that description may be playing down her personality a bit. Gutsy, pushy and savvy, Mengers was the take-no-b.s. power agent for many of Hollywood&#x2019;s boldest bold-faced names in the late 1960s and the &#x2019;70s. . . . <i>Can I Go Now?</i>&#x2014;a title inspired by something Mengers often said to cut short conversations&#x2014;offers plenty of dishy, inside-&#x2019;70s-Hollywood stories, including tales from those soirees at her Beverly Hills home. . . .

Daniel, The Associated Press</b><br><br>&#x201c;Before there was Ovitz or Ari, there was Sue Mengers. During the peak of her clout in the 1970s, the brash barrier-breaker helped popularize the idea of the Hollywood super-agent. The media lapped up her comic crudity . . . her legendary dinner parties attracted Tinseltown&#x2019;s A-list, and <i>60 Minutes</i> came calling to do a lengthy interview that captured Mengers dishing and deal-making. . . . She didn&#x2019;t believe in gussying up hard truths and could be brutally candid with her clients. That lost her some accounts . . . but it also earned her respect. &#x2018;Everyone prized her honesty,&#x2019; Kellow said. &#x2018;In a town like Hollywood, that&#x2019;s hard to come by. . . .

Mengers also set a new standard for female power in the workplace, with a brash, inimitable style that mixed sweet talk and harassment, employing &#x2018;feminine wiles&#x2019; more often than not as a weapon. . . . The story of how a strong woman steamrolled through the Hollywood glass ceiling is an important one, but what makes <i>Can I Go Now?</i> worth reading is its careful chronicling of what happens after the glass shatters, and that woman has to figure out how to stay on top without revealing her wounds.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Karina Longworth, <i>Slate</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A minor masterpiece of Hollywood history in its most exciting, glamorous, and gossip-wise period.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Liz Smith, <i>New York Social Diary</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mengers was a complicated, powerful trailblazer, one who barged down doors for women and changed the nature of the talent-agent business.

Portland, Or.</p><p>The cautionary tale of a world-class high-tech enterprise that hit the skids faster than it reached the heights. Drawing on interviews with key principals, disclosure documents, and allied sources, Boston Globe correspondent Kenney recounts what, save for hubris, could have been a classic American success story. His protagonist is the late An Wang, an inventive genius who left China for the US after WW II. After earning a Ph.D. from Harvard and working on several of the university's pioneering computer projects, Wang went into business for himself in 1951, at age 29. Profitable from the outset, Wang Laboratories rode the crest of the electronic calculator boom and transformed itself into a leading supplier of minicomputers during the early 1970's. The subsequent addition of user-friendly word-processing systems to its product lines helped make the company a multinational colossus with annual revenues topping $3 billion--and a Wall Street favorite. Notwithstanding more than a decade of spectacular growth, however, Wang Labs proved vulnerable on several counts. Its high command, for example, failed to appreciate the potential of personal computers, losing this lucrative market to archrival IBM, which went on to set the industry's standards. As Kenney makes clear, moreover, the vaulting dynastic ambitions of the firm's patriarchal founder (described by one close associate as ``a humble egomaniac'') led to operational and morale problems. Indeed, the reversal in the company's fortunes was so pronounced that by 1989 Wang (who died a year later) felt obliged to fire his son Fred from the presidency (for which, by all accounts, he was unqualified) and bring in a professional management team. Back from the brink of bankruptcy, Wang Labs, Kenney says, will survive as a going concern, albeit in neither the generation-spanning nor cutting-edge form envisioned by its creator. A corporate history bearing vivid witness to the warning that pride goeth before a fall. (Twenty-two photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Chinese immigrant An Wang, a Harvard Ph.D. and computer pioneer, turned a Boston storefront operation into one of the legendary success stories in the computer industry. But by 1985 the glory years at Wang Laboratories had given way to a downward spiral of massive debt, layoffs and late product deliveries. To Boston Globe journalist Kenney, Wang's trajectory resembles a classic tragedy, rooted in a fatal flaw of its secretive, visionary leader--his obsessive desire for control and his placing of family interests ahead of those of shareholders. Wang's biggest mistake, asserts Kenney, was making his son Fred director of R&amp;D, then president. An Wang fired his son in 1989, a year before his own death from cancer. This gripping, remarkably intimate saga discloses behind-the-scenes wrangling from the joyride years through the 1991 deal with IBM whereby Wang sells IBM products globally.

Testing themselves against treacherous currents, braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects, navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield, they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond, brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.<br>But in the fall of 1991, not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface, in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat, its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal, tangled wires, and human bones&#x2013;all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.<br>No identifying marks were visible on the submarine or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian, expert, or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found. In fact, the official records all agreed that there simply could not be a sunken U-boat and crew at that location.<br><br>Over the next six years, an elite team of divers embarked on a quest to solve the mystery. Some of them would not live to see its end. Chatterton and Kohler, at first bitter rivals, would be drawn into a friendship that deepened to an almost mystical sense of brotherhood with each other and with the drowned U-boat sailors&#x2013;former enemies of their country. As the men&#x2019;s marriages frayed under the pressure of a shared obsession, their dives grew more daring, and each realized that he was hunting more than the identities of a lost U-boat and its nameless crew.<br><br>Author Robert Kurson&#x2019;s account of this quest is at once thrilling and emotionally complex, and it is written with a vivid sense of what divers actually experience when they meet the dangers of the ocean&#x2019;s underworld. The story of <b>Shadow Divers</b> often seems too amazing to be true, but it all happened, two hundred thirty feet down, in the deep blue sea.</p><p><b>ROBERT KURSON </b>earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin, then a law degree from Harvard Law School.

Against his better judgment, that fisherman promised to tell Nagle how to find it. The men agreed to meet the next day on the rickety wooden pier that led to Nagle's boat, the Seeker, a vessel Nagle had built to chase possibility. But when the appointed time came, the fisherman was not there. Nagle paced back and forth, careful not to plunge through the pier where its wooden planks had rotted away. He had lived much of his life on the Atlantic, and he knew when worlds were about to shift. Usually, that happened before a storm or when a man's boat broke. Today, however, he knew it was going to happen when the fisherman handed him a scrap of paper, a hand-scrawled set of numbers that would lead to the sunken mystery. Nagle looked into the distance for the fisherman. He saw no one. The salt air blew against the small seashore town of Brielle, tilting the dockside boats and spraying the Atlantic into Nagle's eyes. When the mist died down he looked again. This time, he saw the fisherman approaching, a small square of paper crumpled in his hands. The fisherman looked worried. Like Nagle, he had lived on the ocean, and he also knew when a man's life was about to change.<br><br>In the whispers of approaching autumn, Brielle's rouge is blown away and what remains is the real Brielle, the locals' Brielle. This small seashore town on the central New Jersey coast is the place where the boat captains and fishermen live, where convenience store owners stay open to serve neighbors, where fifth graders can repair scallop dredges. This is where the hangers-on and wannabes and also-rans and once-greats keep believing in the sea. In Brielle, when the customers leave, the town's lines show, and they are the kind grooved by the thin difference between making a living on the water and washing out.<br><br>The Seeker towers above the other boats tied to this Brielle dock, and it's not just the vessel's sixty-five-foot length that grabs one's attention, it's the feeling-from her battered wooden hull and nicked propellers-that she's been places. Conceived in Nagle's imagination, the Seeker was built for a single purpose: to take scuba divers to the most dangerous shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean.<br><br>Nagle was forty years old then, a thin, deeply tanned former Snap-On Tools Salesman of the Year. To see him here, waiting for this fisherman in his tattered T-shirt and thrift-shop sandals, the Jim Beam he kept as best friend slurring his motions, no one would guess that he had been an artist, that in his day Nagle had been great.<br><br>In his twenties, Nagle was already legend in shipwreck diving, a boy wonder in a sport that regularly kills its young. In those days, deep-wreck diving was still the province of the adventurer. Countless shipwrecks, even famous ones, lay undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic, and the hunt for those wrecks-with their bent metal and arrested history-was the motion that primed Nagle's imagination.<br><br>Treasure never figured into the equation for Atlantic shipwreck divers in the Northeast. Spanish galleons overflowing with gold doubloons and silver pieces of eight did not sink in this part of the ocean, and even if they had, Nagle wouldn't have been interested. His neighborhood was the New York and New Jersey shipping lanes, waters that conducted freighters, ocean liners, passenger vessels, and warships about the business and survival of America. These wrecks occasionally surrendered a rare piece of china or jewelry, but Nagle and his kind were looking for something different. They saw stories in the Modiglianied faces of broken ships, frozen moments in a nation's hopes or a captain's dying instinct or a child's potential, and they experienced these scenes unbuffered by curators or commentators or historians, shoulder to shoulder with life as it existed at the moment it had most mattered.<br><br>And they did it to explore. Many of the deep wrecks hadn't been seen since their victims last looked at them, and would remain lost while nature pawed at them until they simply didn't exist anymore. In a world where even the moon had been traveled, the floor of the Atlantic remained uncharted wilderness, its shipwrecks beacons for men compelled to look.<br><br>You had to have steel balls to do what Nagle did in his heyday. In the 1970s and 1980s, scuba equipment was still rudimentary, not much advanced past 1943, when Jacques Cousteau helped invent the system of tanks and regulators that allowed men to breathe underwater. Even at 130 feet, the recreational limit suggested by most scuba training organizations, a minor equipment failure could kill the most skilled practitioner. In searching for the most interesting wrecks, Nagle and the sport's other kings might descend to 200 feet or deeper, virtually begging the forces of nature to flick them into the afterlife, practically demanding their biology to abandon them. Men died-often-diving the shipwrecks that called to Nagle.<br><br>Even if Nagle's equipment and body could survive the deep Atlantic, he faced a smorgasbord of other perils, each capable of killing him ï¿½ la carte. For starters, the sport was still new; there was no ancient wisdom to be passed from father to son, the kind of collective experience that routinely keeps today's divers alive. The sport's cautionary tales, those lifelines learned over beers with buddies and by reading magazines and attending classes, were beaten into Nagle underwater at antihuman depths. If Nagle found himself in some crazy, terrible circumstance-and there were countless of them on these deep wrecks-odds were that he would be the one who would tell the first tale. When he and his ilk survived, the magazines wrote articles about them.<br><br>Nagle pushed deeper. Diving below 200 feet, he began doing things scientists didn't fully understand, going places recreational divers had never been. When he penetrated a shipwreck at these depths, he was often among the first to see the vessel since it had gone down, the first to open the purser's safe since it had been closed, the first to look at these men since they had been lost at sea. But this also meant that Nagle was on his own. He had no maps drawn by earlier divers. Had someone visited these wrecks before, he might have told Nagle, "Don't brush against that outboard beam in the galley-the thing moved when I swam by, and the whole room might cave in and bury you if you do." Nagle had to discover all this by himself. It is one thing, wreck divers will tell you, to slither in near-total darkness through a shipwreck's twisted, broken mazes, each room a potential trap of swirling silt and collapsing structure. It is another to do so without knowing that someone did it before you and lived.<br><br>The Atlantic floor was still a wilderness in Nagle's prime, and it demanded of its explorers the same grit that the American West did of its pioneers. A single bad experience on a shipwreck could reroute all but the hardiest souls to more sensible pursuits. Early divers like Nagle had bad experiences every day. The sport eagerly shook out its dabblers and sightseers; those who remained seemed of a different species. They were physical in their world orientation and sudden in their appetites. They thought nothing of whipping out a sledgehammer and beating a porthole from the side of a ship, even as their heavy breath hastened nitrogen narcosis, the potentially deadly buildup of that otherwise benign gas in their brains. Underwater, rules of possession bent with the light; some divers cut prizes from the mesh goody bags of other divers, following the motto "He who floats it owns it." Fistfights-aboard boats and even underwater-often settled disputes. Artifacts recovered from wrecks were guarded like firstborn children, occasionally at knifepoint. In this way, early deep-wreck divers had a measure of pirate in their blood.<br><br>But not Nagle. In the sport's brawniest era, he was a man of the mind. He devoured academic texts, reference works, novels, blueprints, any material he could uncover on historical ships, until he could have stood in the dockyards of a dozen eras and built the boats alongside the workers. He was a connoisseur of the parts, and he reveled in the life force a boat took on from the interlocking of its pieces. This insight gave Nagle two-way vision; as much as he understood the birth of a ship, he also understood its death. Ordinary divers would come upon a shipwreck and see the mï¿½lange of bent steel and broken wood, the shock of pipe and wire as a cacophony of crap, an impediment that might be hiding a compass or some other prize. They would plant their noses in a random spot and dig like puppies, hoping to find a morsel. Viewing the same scene, Nagle repaired the broken parts in his mind and saw the ship in its glory. One of his greatest finds was a four-foot-tall brass whistle from the paddle wheeler Champion, a proud voice that had been mounted on the ship's mast and powered by a steam line. The whistle was majestic, but the most beautiful part of the discovery was that underwater it looked like a worthless pipe. Floating amid the wreckage, Nagle used his mind's eye to watch the ship break and sink. He knew the ship's anatomy, and as he imagined it coming apart he could see the whistle settle, right where that seemingly worthless piece of pipe lay. After Nagle recovered two helms from the British tanker Coimbra in a single day (finding one helm once in a career was rare enough), his photograph was hung-alongside that of Lloyd Bridges-in the wheelhouse of the Sea Hunter, a leading dive charter boat of the time. He was twenty-five.<br><br>To Nagle, the value in artifacts like the brass steam whistle lay not in their aesthetics or their monetary worth but in their symbolism. It is an odd sight to see grown men covet teacups and saucers, and build noble display cases to these dainty relics. But to divers like Nagle these trinkets represented exploration, going off the charts. A telegraph on display in a diver's living room, therefore, is much more than a shiny object; it is an announcement. It says, If someone had been to this ship's wheelhouse before me, he would not have left this telegraph behind.<br><br>It was only time before Nagle's instinct delivered him to the Andrea Doria, the Mount Everest of shipwrecks. The grand Italian passenger liner had collided with the Stockholm, a Swedish liner, in dense fog off Nantucket Island in 1956. Fifty-one people died; 1,659 were rescued before the liner sank and settled on her side at a depth of 250 feet. The Doria was not a typical target for Nagle. Her location was widely known, and she had been explored by divers since the day after her sinking. But the Doria made siren calls to great wreck divers. She was brimming with artifacts even after all these years: serving sets made of fine Italian china and painted with the ship's legendary Italia logo, silver utensils, luggage, ceramic tiles by famed artists, pewter sherbet dishes, jewelry, signs. In Nagle's day, and even today, a diver could explore the Doria and worry only about having enough stamina to lug home the prizes he recovered.<br><br>Had the Doria only her riches to offer, she could not have romanced Nagle so hopelessly. The ship's real challenge lay in exploration. The wreck rested on its side, making navigation dangerous and deceptive. A diver had to conceive the world sideways to make sense of doors on the floor and ceilings to the right. And she was deep-180 feet at her shallowest and 250 feet where she crushed the ocean floor. Men sometimes got disoriented or ran out of air or lost their minds from narcosis and died on the Doria. The wreck was so deep, dark, and dangerous that decades after her sinking, entire decks remained unexplored. Those decks were Nagle's destinations.<br><br>Over time, Nagle penetrated the wreck in places long relegated to the impossible. His mantel at home became a miniature Doria museum. Soon, he set his sights on the bell. A ship's bell is her crown, her voice. For a diver, there is no greater prize, and many of the greats go a career without coming close to recovering one. Nagle decided to own the Doria's bell. People thought he was nuts-scores of divers had searched for thirty years for the Doria's bell. No one believed it was there.<br><br>Nagle went to work. He studied deck plans, books of photographs, crew diaries. Then he did what few other divers did: he formulated a plan. He would need days, maybe even a week to pull it off. No charter boat, however, was going to take a diver to the Doria for a week. So Nagle, who had saved a good bit of money from his Snap-on Tools days, decided to buy a dive boat himself, a vessel constructed from his imagination for a single purpose: to salvage the Doria's bell.<br><br>That boat was the original Seeker, a thirty-five-foot Maine Coaster built in New Jersey by Henrique. In 1985, Nagle recruited five top divers, men who shared his passion for exploration, and he made this arrangement: He would take the group to the Doria at his expense. The trip would be a dedicated one, meaning the divers went with just one objective-to recover the bell.<br><br>For the first few days on the wreck, the divers stuck to Nagle's plan. They found nothing. The bell just wasn't there. At that point, even the hardiest divers would have turned back. A single day on the open Atlantic in a sixty-five-foot boat will turn intestines inside out; Nagle and his cohorts had been out for four days in a thirty-five-foot glorified bathtub. But a man is not so inclined to give up when he sees in panoramas. Nagle abandoned the bow of the Doria, where he and his team had been searching, and rerouted to the stern. They would now be flying by the seat of their pants, an improvisation on the deadliest wreck in the Atlantic. No one had ever been to the stern. Yet by conceiving the Doria as a single, breathing organism rather than as detached, twenty-foot chunks of wood and steel, Nagle and the others allowed themselves to look in unlikely places.<br><br>On the fifth day they hit pay dirt-there was the Andrea Doria's bell. The men rigged it, beat out the bell's pin with a sledgehammer, and sent up the prize on a heavy-duty lift bag. Shock waves rippled through the diving community. According to their agreement, Nagle owned half the bell, and the other five men owned half; the last man living among them would own it outright. Nagle placed the 150-pound bell into the back of his wife's station wagon and asked her to drive it home.</p><h2>The Last Picture Show (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>The youth of a small town in mid-twentieth-century Texas search for ways to escape boredom and experience life and love</p><p>In <i>The Last Picture Show</i> Larry McMurtry introduced characters who would show up again in later novels, <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane's Depressed</i>. This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Path of the Pole (Mysteries of the Universe)</h2><p>Hapgood&#39;s tour de force is back in print!

These weren&#39;t simply variations on apes, but upright-walking humans who lived side by side, competing, cooperating, sometimes even mating with our direct ancestors. Why did the line of ancient humans who eventually evolved into us survive when the others were shown the evolutionary door? Chip Walter draws on new scientific discoveries to tell the fascinating tale of how our survival was linked to our ancestors being born more prematurely than others, having uniquely long and rich childhoods, evolving a new kind of mind that made us resourceful and emotionally complex; how our highly social nature increased our odds of survival; and why we became self aware in ways that no other animal seems to be. Last Ape Standing also profiles the mysterious &#34;others&#34; who evolved with us-the Neanderthals of Europe, the &#34;Hobbits&#34; of Indonesia, th</p><p><p><b>Amazon Q&amp;A with Chip Walter, author of <i>Last Ape Standing</i> </b></p> <p>Photo by Richard Kelly Photography</p> <p><b>1.</b>: Your previous book, <i>Thumbs, Toes and Tears</i>, helped explain human nature by looking at traits that are unique to humans and then exploring how they came to be. Since that book was written, it&#x2019;s become increasingly clear that many other species of humans co-existed and competed in the past, and that now all of them are gone, but one. Us. Why have we survived when so many others failed?</p> <p><b>Chip Walter</b>: It&#x2019;s fascinating how that happened because on the surface it really doesn&#x2019;t make any evolutionary sense. Our direct line of ancestors faced a dilemma more than a million years ago that could have ended them right there and then. Their brains were growing larger AND they had taken to walking upright at the same time. Both adaptations were helpful except for one problem: walking upright narrows the birth canal and that makes it difficult to bring larger brained babies to full term. The solution was to bring the babies into the world prematurely, and extend their childhood longer AFTER birth. You wouldn&#x2019;t think that bringing increasingly helpless preemies into existence and then lengthening the time it takes for them to have the next generation of children wouldn&#x2019;t seem to be a very effective survival strategy. Might be smarter to shorten childhood and have more babies faster. If you were a betting ape in those days, you wouldn&#x2019;t have given our direct ancestors much of chance. But the creativity and inventiveness our uniquely long childhoods make possible are the reasons, ultimately; that we survived when so many others were shown the evolutionary door.</p> <p><b>2.</b>: You say that at one point the human race had been whittled down to near extinction, and only a few thousand of us remained. Why? How did we bounce back?</p> <p><b>CW</b>: Around 75,000 years ago the genetic evidence indicates we were, at best, down to a few thousand childbearing Homo sapiens. This would mean there were fewer of us than there are wild chimpanzees on Earth right now. The planet was in the grip of a very nasty ice age that had dried out most of Africa. Pockets of Homo sapiens existed in South Africa and maybe a few other locations. Around this time there was also an immense volcanic eruption in Indonesia and the Homo sapiens in Africa were in the path of the ash cloud. (Other human species were not down wind or in the direct path.) Ironically, around the same time you begin to see the first glimmers of human creativity and symbolic thinking which is necessary for things like art, sculpture and language. Those extra skills apparently helped us bounce back, generate newer, better survival strategies and share innovative ideas.</p> <p><b>3.</b>: You have a chapter in the book entitled &#x201c;The Moral Primate." You point out that most other animals aren&#x2019;t, don&#x2019;t worry about being fair, but we struggle with good and evil all the time. Where does our sense of morality come from?</p> <p><b>CW</b>: One of the outcomes of a longer childhood for us was that our ancestors found themselves faced with two BIG problems. They had already been forced out of the jungle into the savannas of Africa. Savannas are far more dangerous places to live and survive&#x2014;more predators, less available food, greater distances to cover. On top of this, they now had to deal with raising these &#x201c;early-born&#x201d; infants and children who required their care for longer and longer periods of time. So how do you deal with that without getting wiped out? You bond, you rely upon one another more than ever to help keep the whole troop alive. BUT it&#x2019;s not quite that simple because at the same time you also have to compete with the very same people you rely on for help. You contend with them for mates, for food, for power and status within the troop. This is one of the great paradoxes of the human condition. We all must both compete and cooperate with one another. This raised the first &#x201c;moral&#x201d; questions. Do you put yourself first, or do you put others in the group first? Do you kill, bully or hurt another to get more food, a mate, more power in the short term, and if so, what are the long term consequences? You could be killed or bullied yourself, or tossed from the group, the equivalent of suicide on the savanna. Longer term, you might need that person&#x2019;s help some day. Maybe thinking a little less selfishly would be a good idea? So we evolved a basic moral code, one in which we want to be treated by others the way we treat them&#x2014;the golden rule, which is universal and expressed in virtually every human culture on earth.</p><p><b>Chip Walter</b> is the founder of the popular website AllThingsHuman.net, a former CNN bureau chief, feature film screenwriter, PBS documentary filmmaker, and author-in-residence at the Mellon Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

In Ancient Rome, brother and sister twins Maximus and Vanilla are "doomed" to be slaves to the demanding, lazy Slobbus Pompius and his vain wife. Rhyming couplets spiritedly describe how Maxi and Vanilla perform legion tasks at home, and then, exhausted, must schlep their masters through the streets of town: "Not daring to complain, nonetheless the pair felt bitter,/ Forced to fetch and cart around two fatties on a litter." But Pompius stretches his luck too far when he instructs the twins to do away with his new horse Polydox, just because Polydox (in a vintage display of horse sense) refuses to obey him. Instead, spunky Maximus and Vanilla run away with the steed and?after two new friendships, a chariot race and a brush with Ostrogoths?they finally avenge their despicable master and mistress. Gerrard's paintings tweak traditional proportion and perspective to highly amusing end as the artist puts his distinctive stamp on such period particulars as togas and sandals, lavish mosaics and monumental architecture.

From recurring debates over the war in Vietnam to the perpetually appealing music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stone to the concern about youth drug use, the legacy of the 1960s is ubiquitous in contemporary life. <i>The Summer of Love</i> brings together an impressive group of historians, artists, and cultural critics to present a rich and varied interpretation of this seminal decade and its continuing influence on politics, society, and culture. <br><br><i>The Summer of Love</i>, which accompanies an exhibition at Tate Liverpool, pays particular attention to the wildly creative psychedelic art of the era. Perceptive essays on psychedelic comics, graphic design and typography, light shows, and film successfully rescue psychedelic art from the fog of nostalgia and unjust critical neglect. Distinguished contributors also explore the role of 1960s fashion and architecture, and they consider anew the central influence of hallucinogenic drugs on the art of the era. Running throughout the essays are the elements of epochal change&#x2014;from sexual liberation to student revolutions&#x2014;that still form the backdrop of our collective consciousness of the 1960s. <br><br>An incisive collection of writings on all aspects of 1960s art and culture, tempered by time and critical distance, <i>The Summer of Love</i> will be indispensable for those who wish they had been there&#x2014;or for those who were, but can't remember it.</p><p><p></p><b>Jonathan Harris</b> is professor of art history at the University of Liverpool.

Suddenly, Sherman finds himself embroiled in the most brutal, high-profile case of the year, as prosecutors, politicians, the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers rush in to further their own political and social agendas. With so many egos at stake, the last priority on anyone's mind is truth or justice, in this bitingly hilarious American satire.</p><p>After Tom Wolfe defined the '60s in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> and <i>Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</i> and the cultural U-turn at the turn of the '80s in <i>The Right Stuff</i>, nobody thought he could ever top himself again. In 1987, when <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> arrived, the literati called Wolfe an "aging enfant terrible."<p> He wasn't aging; he was growing up. <i>Bonfire</i>'s pyrotechnic satire of 1980s New York wasn't just Wolfe's best book, it was the best bestselling fiction debut of the decade, a miraculously realistic study of an unbelievably status-mad society, from the fiery combatants of the South Bronx to the bubbling scum at the top of Wall Street. Sherman McCoy, a farcically arrogant investment banker (dubbed a "Master of the Universe," Wolfe's brilliant metaphorical co-opting of a then-important toy for boys), hits a black guy in the Bronx with his Mercedes and runs--right into a nightmare peopled by vicious mistresses, thin wives like "social x-rays," slime-bag politicos, tabloid hacks, and Dantesque denizens of the "justice" system. If the Coen and Marx brothers together dramatized <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Wolfe's <i>Bonfire</i> would probably be funnier. Many think his second novel, <i>A Man in Full</i>, is deeper, but <i>Bonfire</i> will never die down.</p><p> You might find it interesting to compare the film <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, a fascinating calamity perpetrated by the geniuses Brian De Palma and Tom Hanks, with <i>The Right Stuff</i>, one of the very best films of the '80s. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"A big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"It's the human comedy, on a skyscraper scale and at a taxi-meter pace . . . . "<br>--<i>Newsweek</i></p><p>"<i>Bonfire</i> moves with a swift comic logic . . . .

What was true for Brigit in fifth century Ireland is all the more true for us in the complex and increasingly cynical world of the twenty-first century <p>To be a soul friend, Edward Sellner reminds us, "is to provide a place of sanctuary to another where, through our acceptance, love, and hospitality, he or she can grow in wisdom, and both of us in depth." With deep personal conviction and with lively scholarship, Sellner describes the history of the anamchara or soul friend and the early Celtic Church out of which it arose. He leads us on a lively exploration of the ancient Druids and the early desert monks of Egypt, whose traditions and practices were the foundation of soul friendship. He shares with us the unique qualities of soul friendship in the lives of great saints like Ita and Brendan, Brigit and Patrick, and Ciaran and Kevin. And he offers a profound portrait of the Celtic spirituality out of which the anamchara emerged, a spirituality with a deep appreciation of nature, a respect for women's gifts and leadership, and a holistic perspective on the relationship of the mind and the body. The Celtic Soul Friend will be lively and informative reading for anyone interested in the rich tradition of spiritual direction and companionship, as well as the roots of mentoring and support groups. Sellner's description of Celtic spirituality offers a vision of Christianity that cuts across denominational and ethnic boundaries and speaks to the hearts of contemporary Christians of all backgrounds.</p></p><p>Edward C. Sellner, Ph.D. is professor of pastoral theology and spirituality at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Volume 3: Plague of Frogs</h2><p>Hellboy creator Mike Mignola finally reveals Abe Sapien&#39;s bizarre history. Introduced in the first Hellboy book and featured prominently in the film, Abe Sapien has remained one of the most intriguing mysteries of Mignola&#39;s celebrated work. The recent Hellboy film steered clear of any origin story for Abe so that the tale could be told in Plague of Frogs. The story of Abe&#39;s origins unfolds as the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense try to stop the monstrous frog men from the first Hellboy graphic novel, Seed of Destruction. The plague begins its spread across America, lending an apocalyptic new direction to Mignola&#39;s stories.</p><p><i>Hellboy</i> spinoff <i>B.P.R.D.</i> finally comes into its own in the long story constituting the third collection of the comic book. <i>Plague of Frogs</i> explains where <i>B.P.R.D.</i> regular Abe Sapiens, who is amphibious, came from. It's what's known in the superhero biz as an origins story, and it implies that Abe is an emanation in a time loop. He has a -nineteenth-century manifestation that he accesses from the present via something like the astral plane. No birth-equivalent is suggested, so whether Abe exists in other periods, too, is an open question. The revelation about Abe arises from a series-typical spooky caper involving highly evolved fungi escaping from a secret lab with the aid of a possessed professor, an outbreak of frog-monsters traceable to a cult that has taken over a small New England town, a fiery showdown of cult-and-monsters versus Abe and his Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense colleagues, and Abe's near-death. Writer-artist Mignola surrenders drawing duties to Davis, whose broader palette, suppler line, and more intricate backgrounds serve an often-dialogueless scenario superbly. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Drawing on years of research, writing, and counseling about marriage and the family, interviews with more than two hundred couples, and her own experiences, Lillian Rubin explains not just how the differences between women and men arise but how they affect such critical issues as intimacy, sexuality, dependency, work, and parenting.

Farley Mowat advances a controversial new theory about the first visitors to North America.<br>Mowat's <i>Westviking: The Ancient Norse in Greenland and North America</i> (1965) was highly influential in helping to establish the belief, now commonly held, that the Norse visited North America some 500 years before Columbus. And yet "a worm of unease" plagued Mowat even then, a vague feeling that he hadn't gotten it quite right. He spent the next 30 years in search of a theory that would explain inconsistencies in the archaeological evidence (such as carbon-dated ruins not left by the Inuit, but that predated the arrival of Vikings in Newfoundland by hundreds of years). Now in <i>The Farfarers</i> he asserts that another Indo-European people he calls the "Alban" preceded the Norse by several centuries. <br>Throughout <i>The Farfarers</i>, Mowat skillfully weaves fictional vignettes of Alban life into his thoughtful reconstruction of a forgotten history. What emerges is a bold and dramatic panorama of a harsher age: an age of death-dealing warships and scanty food supply, of long, cold journeys across the night sea into unknown lands. <br>"A spellbinding story . . . told by a master storyteller at the top of his form." -- <i>The Globe And Mail<br></i><br><br>"The book is a fascinating glimpse of yesteryear and offers brief histories on the Celts, Saxons, Vikings, Inuits, and other peoples of the northern hemisphere. Written in vigorous, picturesque prose." -- <i>The Edmonton Sun</i></p><p>Farley Mowat's niggling doubts began in the summer of 1966, while he was tooling around the Canadian Arctic aboard a single-engine Otter float plane. The previous year, he had published the influential <i>Westviking</i>, a book that presaged the now widely held opinion that the Norse arrived in North America some 500 years before Columbus. But what Mowat found that summer of '66--troubling evidence that would be buttressed by determined research and field work over the next 30-odd years--convinced him that he had gotten it all wrong. Another group of Europeans, whom Mowat calls the "Albans," beat the Norsemen to the punch by a few hundred years, arriving in North America as they were both fleeing the rapacious Vikings and pursuing precious walrus ivory.<p> A professional scientist but an amateur anthropologist, Mowat likes to stir the pot--and he does it well, with a combination of scientific rigor, good-natured wit, and old-fashioned storytelling. (It's easy to imagine Mowat as an ideal companion out on the monotonous tundra, spinning endless stories over wine and cigarettes.) Interspersed among discussions of the Albans' culture, ethnography, and use of technology, Mowat's speculations on their trips and travails in fictional "vignettes" fill in the "immense lacunae" in the historical record. But his reasoning is always so sound--and his narrative so captivating--that you'll find it hard not to join Mowat's speculative journey with the Farfarers. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>FARLEY MOWAT was born in Ontario in 1921, served in World War II, and spent two years in the Arctic before he began writing for a living in 1949. He has published over 30 books, which have sold more than 14 million copies in 52 languages.

He is the author of two particularly imaginative versions of legends about Christian saints: <i>The</i><i>Life of the Seven Sleepers</i> and <i>The</i><i>Life of St. Josaphaz</i>. Both of these stories are among the most remarkable products of the complex cultural interchanges that took place between East and West throughout the Middle Ages. <i>Seven Sleepers</i> recounts the legend of seven young men from the city of Ephesus, who are rescued from persecution only by a miraculous sleep that lasts for over three centuries. The protagonist of <i>Josaphaz</i> is essentially a version of the Buddha himself, who is depicted here as a beautiful young prince of India converted to Christianity, but then subjected to a series of deceptions and temptations at the hands of his doting but tyrannical father. The third of the three works ascribed to Chardri, <i>The Little Debate</i>, is a philosophical dialogue between two representative figures, an Old Man and a Young Man, who together present lively and dramatically contrasting responses to the problem of human suffering in the world.</p></p><p>Neil Cartlidge is Professor in the Department of English Studies at the University of Durham.

The Bannock, a branch of the Northern Paiute, acquired the horse in the eighteenth century and developed a culture similar in many ways to that of the Plains Indians. Possessed of an aggressive and warlike spirit, the Bannock soon achieved the reputation of being skillful horse thieves and courageous warriors. The first white explorers left accounts of their difficulties with the proud and turbulent Bannock, and Bannock warriors soon became the scourge of the western roads from Fort Bridger to Humboldt Sink and Fort Boise. This ended when General Patrick E. Connor&#39;s California Volunteers defeated a combined force of Shoshoni and Bannock in 1863 in the nation&#39;s largest massacre of Indians at Bear River.Brigham D.

Most of this instructive and funny book is written in dialogue form and based on film classes Mamet taught at Columbia University. He encourages his students to tell their stories not with words, but through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. The best films, Mamet argues, are composed of simple shots. The great filmmaker understands that the burden of cinematic storytelling lies less in the individual shot than in the collective meaning that shots convey when they are edited together. Mamet borrows many of his ideas about directing, writing, and acting from Russian masters such as Konstantin Stanislavsky, Sergei M. Eisenstein, and Vsevelod Pudovkin, but he presents his material in so delightful and lively a fashion that he revitalizes it for the contemporary reader.Calling on this unique perspective as playwright, screenwriter, and director of his own critically acclaimed movies, House Of Games and Things Change, David Mamet illuminates how a film comes to be. He looks at every aspect of directing--from script to cutting room--to show the many tasks directors undertake in reaching their prime objective: presenting a story that will be understood by the audience and has the power to be both surprising and inevitable at the same time.</p><h2>The Hell Screen: A Mystery of 11th-Century Japan Featuring Sugawara Akitada (Penguin Mysteries)</h2><p><b>A tangled web of deceit strikes very close to home in this new mystery of ancient Japan featuring Sugawara Akitada</b><br><br>Eleventh-century Japan is the expertly realized setting for I.

In <i>The Hell Screen</i>, Akitada is on his way to the bedside of his dying mother when bad weather forces him to take refuge in a temple whose central treasure is a brilliantly painted hell screen. Perhaps its violent imagery influences his dreams: that night he is awakened by a scream. It?s only after Akitada returns to a scene of domestic unhappiness and scandal that the significance of that cry becomes clear.

She writes regularly for <b>Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine</b>.<br>ONE<br>The Mountain Temple<br>The path was rocky and the horse&#x2019;s hooves slipped on the wet stones. Rain hung in the air like a thick mist. In a gully a miniature waterfall had formed, its muddy current splashing and gurgling downhill. Patches of wet fog hung between the sagging branches of tall cryptomerias like giant jeweled cobwebs.<br>The tall rider sat hunched forward in the steady downpour, his big sedge hat joining seamlessly with the straw rain cape covering his body. At a turn in the path he straightened and peered ahead. Ah, finally! The curving blue-tiled roof and the red-lacquered columns of the main gate to the temple lay just ahead. Beyond the plaster walls, dimly seen in the grayness of mist and rain, rose a graceful five-storied pagoda and the many roofs of temple halls and monastic outbuildings.<br>The tired horse smelled stables and shook his head, releasing a shower of water. Its rider was Sugawara Akitada, returning to the capital from one of the far northern provinces. Akitada was still young, in his mid-thirties, and physically strong, but days of forced riding had worn him out. The steady cold rain had made this particular day&#x2019;s journey across the mountains especially wearying, and now, in the fading light of early evening, he was forced to seek the temple&#x2019;s hospitality: a simple room, a hot bath, and a vegetarian supper.<br>Two other travelers had reached the gate ahead of him. The man had already dismounted and was solicitously helping a lady from her horse. They both wore rain gear similar to Akitada&#x2019;s, but the woman&#x2019;s broad-rimmed hat was also covered by a thick veil, sagging with moisture. She rearranged it impatiently and walked up the steps to the gateway, the lavishly embroidered hem of her gown sweeping through the mud behind her.<br>As Akitada stopped to dismount, her companion struck the bronze bell at the gate. Its high clear metallic sound broke the peaceful splash and drizzle of the rain. Almost immediately the gate opened and an elderly monk appeared, looking uncertainly from the couple to the tall rider waiting behind them.<br>The woman&#x2019;s companion, unaware of Akitada, explained, &#x201c;We are traveling to Otsu and cannot go any farther today. Can you give us shelter?&#x201d;<br>The monk hesitated. &#x201c;Is the other gentleman with you?&#x201d;<br>They both turned then to look in surprise at Akitada, who looked back calmly. Though he could not see the lady&#x2019;s face behind all that wet veiling, he knew she was young, for she moved quickly and with studied grace. The man was stocky, well-built, and in his late twenties. He wore traveling clothes of good quality and, like Akitada, had a sword stuck through his sash. A gentleman, perhaps. Certainly a member of the affluent class. His face was not handsome, but open and friendly, and he bowed politely to Akitada before telling the monk, &#x201c;Oh, no. There are just the two of us. This gentleman is a stranger to my sister-in-law and myself.&#x201d;<br>The woman moved impatiently, extending a smooth white arm from under her rain cape to gesture to her companion to hurry. Multiple layers of fine silk, in shades from russet to lavender, peeked out from under the cream-colored satin sleeve of her robe. The embroidery on the sleeve and hem was of autumn leaves and chrysanthemums.<br>A very rich lady indeed, thought Akitada, who was tying his horse next to their mounts and noting the costly saddles. Bowing deeply to her, he hoped she would remove the veil so he could see her face. But he was disappointed, for she abruptly turned her back to him. He told the monk, &#x201c;Please accommodate your guests first. I shall wait for your return.&#x201d;<br>The lady ignored Akitada&#x2019;s courtesy, but her companion bowed his acknowledgment.<br>&#x201c;Are there many visitors here tonight?&#x201d; the lady asked, slipping off her wet rain cape for the young man to pick up.<br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, madam,&#x201d; the monk replied.<br>&#x201c;And what sort of people might they be?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, mostly ordinary,&#x201d; said the old man, turning to shuffle barefooted down the long covered corridor to the right. They followed him. Akitada stepped up under the gateway to watch them walk away.<br>&#x201c;Ordinary?&#x201d; she asked, her voice rising a little. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mostly pilgrims, madam. And a group of players who put on bugaku dances for the local people. But don&#x2019;t worry. They are in a different building.&#x201d;<br>She pursued the topic, but Akitada could no longer make out the words. He slipped out of his wet rain cape and took off the sedge hat, chuckling at the lady&#x2019;s fears that she might have to rub shoulders with the common people. He reflected ruefully that she had evidently not approved of him, either, when she saw him in his cheap rain gear and on a hired horse. Underneath the straw cape he wore a sober brown hunting robe over fawn-colored silk trousers which he had tucked into his leather riding boots. A long sword was pushed through his wide leather belt. His slender, deeply tanned face with the heavy eyebrows might have belonged to a scholar or a warrior, but was to his mind ordinary. And he thought his narrow straight back and waist and the broad shoulders lacked both grace and muscular bulk.<br>He laid his wet straw cape and hat on the railing of the balustrade and looked out across the large courtyard toward the main temple hall. Memories stirred of visits to this place back in the days of his childhood. He had been accompanied by his imperious mother and two younger sisters, along with nursemaids and servants. How would he find them now? Was his mother still alive? The message of her severe illness had reached them two weeks earlier, on their homeward journey, and Akitada had pushed ahead alone, leaving his wife and small son to follow more slowly with the luggage and servants.<br>Now he was only a short day&#x2019;s ride from the capital and worried about what he would find. Akiko, the elder of his two sisters, had married an official during his absence and moved away, but Yoshiko was still at home. He tried to imagine his mother ill, her fierce strength gone, and only the bitterness remaining. He sighed.<br>Steady streams of water descended along the chains suspended from the monstrous snouts of rain spouts above him and splashed with a great din into pebble troughs. Across the courtyard the tall pagoda rose into the mist, its top lost above the clouds. The scent of pines hung in the air and mingled with the sweetish odor of wet straw and sedge. But for this miserable rain he would have made better time and arrived home this very night. Instead, he and his horse were near physical collapse after hours of trudging through deep mud and roaring torrents.<br>The gatekeeper returned, his soles whispering softly on the smooth boards of the gallery. &#x201c;Forgive the delay, sir,&#x201d; he said, glancing at Akitada&#x2019;s clothing and sword. &#x201c;Has your honor come to worship or for lodging?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lodging only, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; Akitada produced a visiting card and handed it to the monk, who peered at it and bowed deeply.<br>&#x201c;A great honor, my lord,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;May I conduct you to the abbot?&#x201d;<br>Akitada suppressed a sigh. He was bone-tired and in no mood for courtesies over fruit juice, but the visit was obligatory for men of his rank.<br>This time the monk turned to the left and led the way to the inner courts of the temple and its monastery. After an eternity of galleries and corridors, he paused before an unadorned door made of beautifully polished wood. It was opened by an acolyte, a boy of ten or eleven. In the room behind him sat a very old man on a small dais.<br>&#x201c;His Reverence, Genshin,&#x201d; murmured the monk.<br>Genshin was frail, almost skeletal, and his skin stretched like yellowed paper across his shaven skull. He wore a dark silk robe and a very beautiful stole patched from many-colored pieces of brocade. A string of amber beads slid slowly through fingers thin as the claws of a bird. His eyes were closed, the lids almost transparent, and the thin, pursed lips moved silently.<br>&#x201c;Reverence?&#x201d; whispered the gatekeeper. &#x201c;Lord Sugawara wishes to pay his respects.&#x201d;<br>A bead moved as they waited, and then another. Finally the thin lids lifted and faded eyes looked at Akitada. &#x201c;Sugawara no Michizane?&#x201d; Genshin&#x2019;s voice sounded like the rustling of dry leaves.<br>Michizane, long dead though never forgotten? &#x201c;No, Your Reverence,&#x201d; said Akitada, stepping forward and bowing deeply. &#x201c;I am afraid I have little in common with my illustrious ancestor. I am Akitada, most recently provisional governor of Echigo.&#x201d; He said it with an odd mixture of pride and humility. Echigo had been a punitive and punishing assignment, and only he knew how hard-won his achievements had been.<br>The abbot shook his head confusedly. &#x201c;Governor? I thought . . .&#x201d; His voice trailed off and the lids closed again.<br>Apparently the courtesy visit was going to be more difficult than Akitada had anticipated. He sought for words that might wake the old man to some semblance of conversation. &#x201c;I have been recalled to the capital. A few years ago I held a minor position in the Ministry of Justice.&#x201d;<br>The lids lifted marginally. &#x201c;Justice?&#x201d; Genshin pursed his lips thoughtfully. &#x201c;Yes. Justice. Why not? It&#x2019;s an appropriate choice. Please be seated, Akitada. I am delighted that you have come to see me.&#x201d;<br>Akitada suppressed his puzzlement and sat, wondering how to explain to this senile cleric that only the accident of a rainstorm had driven him to this Buddhist temple. Aloud he said, &#x201c;I am here for a brief rest only, Your Reverence, a chance to gather my thoughts and refresh my spirit.&#x201d; And that was not far from the truth.<br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; Genshin nodded eagerly. &#x201c;Of course. Then listen: He who seeks the Law will find it in the mountain groves.

I was to go with him to the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam. And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that of Saint Peter opened a mysterious door. "Ring the bell," he said, "when you come back and want to get out," and with a great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the noise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new and strange experiences. For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon of audible silence. When we had climbed the first flight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited knowledge of natural phenomena&#x2014;that of tangible darkness. A match showed us where the upward road continued. We went to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly we had plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with the roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom. Covered with many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols of a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good people of the city many years ago. That which had meant life and death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rubbish. The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the outspread arms of a kindly saint. The next floor showed us from where we had derived our light. Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made the high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of pigeons. The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was filled with a weird and pleasing music. It was the noise of the town below us, but a noise which had been purified and cleansed by the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking of horses' hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing sound of the patient steam which had been set to do the work of man in a thousand different ways&#x2014;they had all been blended into a softly rustling whisper which provided a beautiful background for the trembling cooing of the pigeons. Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And after the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel his way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even greater wonder, the town-clock. I saw the heart of time. I could hear the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds&#x2014;one&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;up to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise when all the wheels seemed to stop and another minute had been chopped off eternity. Without pause it began again&#x2014;one&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;until at last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels a thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was the hour of noon.</p><p></p><h2>Worth the Wait (Guthrie Brothers)</h2><p><strong>Ready or not...love will find a way</strong><br><br>Single dad Hogan Guthrie is getting his life back on track, and working as the &#x201c;barbecue master&#x201d; at a local diner is just a temporary detour.

Someday I plan to traverse their pages and see for myself what raw weight they wield. Actually, I have read a handful of them Dickens, Dostoevsky, Twain, Fitzgerald, Voltaire but in a haphazard, zigzagging fashion. No chronology, historical context, or classroom guidance.<br> I dropped out of school early and started work at a young age, but I spent a lot of time hanging around LACC, an inner-city community college a few miles from my mother&#x2019;s house. I made friends with some of the professors. One of them lived with the poet Wanda Coleman, and I was invited to hang out at their place behind the campus. I got to sit in and hear their discussions on writers and writing. That was where I first realized that there were myriad subtexts to a given piece of writing, and that writers seemed to be able to tap into the profundities of daily existence.<br> I kind of knew these themes and patterns were always there in books and stories, but these people seemed to have some key, some tool to unlock the densest texts or find some illuminating insight into a mundane occurrence. It was mysterious to me how they pulled these observations out of their hats. Was it education, experience, divination an innate sense of the world?<br> I started picking up books from thrift stores and spent a lot of time hanging out at the library. The books I came upon were pretty random, a patchwork more than a definitive list. James Baldwin, H. G. Wells&#x2019;s history of the world, Sam Shepard&#x2019;s plays. The library became my other home. I didn&#x2019;t have a bedroom in my mom&#x2019;s house, so the library was one of the only places I could go and be alone. When that downtown library burned down, it was a big blow to me. I remember watching the five o&#x2019;clock news big black plumes billowing out of the windows, and all those books burning.<br> Later, I tried some of the smaller neighborhood libraries, but they were disappointing. A bunch of romance novels, ancient how-to intructionals, and some worn-out kids&#x2019; books.<br><br>I made friends with this kid from Laos who worked in a cool little bookshop in the then-uncool East Hollywood neighborhood of Los Feliz. Books were not always available and became somewhat of a commodity, so I&#x2019;d go up there and we&#x2019;d hang around, talk about writers, and he&#x2019;d show me the new books they&#x2019;d gotten in. He was into obscure stuff, like a German poet named Georg Trakl or St.- John Perse. We&#x2019;d sit around on long summer afternoons reading magazines and bits from various books. In a way, it was kind of our own nonrequired reading. We were picking up various writings and mashing them up into some kind of piecemeal perspective. Not having any academic structure about us, everything we gravitated to probably had the weight of something discovered on one&#x2019;s own, like we&#x2019;d uncovered some secret thing nobody else knew. Which is kind of an adolescent thrill, or pomposity, but I&#x2019;m still guilty of it.<br> There was an old art house movie theater next door. We were friendly with the assistant manager, and he would let us in for free. The Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire played for six or seven months and we must have seen it thirty times. We&#x2019;d hang out in the projection booth sometimes, already having memorized all the scenes. I remember that it started out in a library, with an angel listening in on people&#x2019;s thoughts. We knew there was something going on in this movie and we&#x2019;d learned what that was from reading.<br> We were also listening to Sonic Youth&#x2019;s Evol, Einstï¿½rzende Neubauten, and old Delta blues. It seemed like we&#x2019;d found what was relevant to us. The required world seemed a little gray and uninspired maybe. We were digging into the nonrequired past (which I think was the thing to do at the time). I remember Georges Bataille being very cool at the time. Also an old hobo account from the 1930s by Jack Black (the hobo, not the movie star) called You Can&#x2019;t Win had recently been rediscovered and reissued. Even quasi-sci-fi writers like Philip K. Dick were being reassessed and held in high regard. There wasn&#x2019;t much talk of the classics. It was more about the stuff that had gotten missed in between the major important&#x201d; works. It was like there was a questioning and a mistrust that were manifested in this stream of curiosities forming a new forgotten canon. But trends change and perspective shifts. Works sometimes speak to a moment or fill a need at the time. And the classics still stand unmoved.<br><br>When I came upon this series a few years back, it immediately made sense to me. It was what I was always doing: reading things here and there in airports, in waiting rooms, and on tour busess. There are always those bits from some article a weird fact, an anecdote, an image even you pick up somewhere that become lodged in youuuuur brain, just as deeply as anything would from a great novel or film. Sometimes those things crop up outside of the great canon of literature and only breathe into our awareness for a minute. If literature moves slow and we live in dog years, this book may come in handy. I&#x2019;ve found the mix-tape aesthetic works for me. The humor and the humane, the hugeness and the miniature. It coheres into some other kind of implied story or novel that we&#x2019;re still living out. This is something we&#x2019;re figuring out together and apart, like it or not.<br> And if you want some advice you&#x2019;ll get only in this book: don&#x2019;t fall asleep riding a bicycle like my friend Brian did. You might wake up bleeding in a rent-a-cop car.<br><br> Beck Los Angeles, 2005 <br><br> Copyright ï¿½ 2005 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Introduction copyright ï¿½ 2005 by Beck.

It was his favorite view, offering a sweeping expanse of the front yard, the drive and the trees beyond, but at the moment, he scarcely saw it. His thoughts were turned inward, to his nephew and the young man's death six months ago. He had not been close, he supposed, to Edmund; he was not, he admitted, close to any of his relatives&#x2014;a fault, no doubt Honoria would tell him, of his own nature. But he had been fond of Edmund, and had thought him a man of great talent and promise. Anthony had been saddened by the news of Edmund's death, and he was certain that the world would be poorer for the music that it had lost.</p><p> </p><p>It had been clear for years that Edmund would not have a long life.

He was a man who preferred to live his own life free of others' interference, and he liked to return the favor.</p><p> </p><p>But Honoria had pleaded with him, hands clasped dramatically to her heaving bosom. He must save her only son from the clutches of a money-hungry harpy, she had told him. Edmund was so young and inex-perienced that he had asked an American adventur-ess to marry him. Eleanor Townsend, Honoria was convinced, had tricked her son into it. Anthony, she had decided, must call upon the American siren who had ensnared Edmund and convince her not to marry him. An offer of money, in Honoria's opinion, would speak volumes with the adventuress.</p><p> </p><p>Honoria, who was in fact his half sister, had, of course, reminded him of his duty as the head of the family and especially of his duty regarding her. She had been fourteen years old when his mother had died giving birth to him and had, at least according to Honoria herself, practically raised him. And, she pointed out, he of all people should know the harm that could be done by a beautiful adventuress who lured a rich man into marriage.</p><p> </p><p>Anthony was well aware of his responsibilities to his family; it was a lesson that had been pounded into his head from childhood. However, he was also quite aware that for his sister, the earl's duties usually co-incided with her own wishes. And since he knew that Honoria had married and left the house when he was five years old, and that he had been primarily raised by his old nurse and a succession of governesses until he was old enough to be sent away to Eton, he was generally unmoved by Honoria's claims to have been "almost a mother" to him.</p><p> </p><p>Ordinarily, he would have turned down her request, disavowing that one of his responsibilities was meddling about in the private life of a grown man of twenty-four years of age.</p><p> </p><p>But Sir Edmund was different. There was a child-like innocence to him that one rarely saw in an aris-tocratic young gentleman, and he was possessed of a talent that both awed and puzzled Anthony. He suspected that Edmund was a musical genius, but the young man's experience with the world&#x2014;and his ability to deal with it&#x2014;were as small as his talent was large. Anthony, being fonder of the young man than he was of most of his relatives, had hated to see him crushed between his mother and his fiancï¿½e.</p><p> </p><p>Besides, Honoria was right about one thing: He <i>did</i> have a wealth of personal experience in the area of the harm wrought by a beautiful, money-hungry woman. His father had married one when Anthony was sixteen, and she had managed to drive a wedge between Anthony and his father that had almost de-stroyed their relationship.</p><p> </p><p>So, finally, Anthony had agreed to her request, and here he was, standing on Eleanor Townsend's doorstep. He allowed himself a small, vain hope that no one would answer the door.</p><p> </p><p>At that moment the door swung open, revealing a man who looked like no other servant Anthony had ever seen. He was short and squarely built, the muscles of his chest and arms straining against the cloth of his jacket. One ear was peculiarly mis-shapen; his nose appeared to have been broken at least once in the past, and there were two or three small scars on his face. He looked, Anthony thought, more like a pugilist or a ruffian than a servant.</p><p> </p><p>"Lord Neale," Anthony told him, extracting a calling card from his case and extending it to him.</p><p> </p><p>Unlike a proper British footman or butler, the man did not hold out a small silver tray for him to place the card upon but simply took it from Anthony's hand. He examined it somewhat suspi-ciously, then nodded to Anthony.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll tell her you're here," the man told him and strode away, leaving Anthony standing in the entry hall.</p><p> </p><p>Anthony watched him leave, astonished. It was the first time he could remember ever being left to wait in the hall when he called upon someone. His title and wealth usually earned him a deferential bow, after which he was escorted to the best drawing room.</p><p> </p><p>Another man might have been offended. Anthony found it rather amusing.</p><p> </p><p>Well, Honoria <i>had</i> warned him that Miss Townsend and her household were decidedly "off." She was, first of all, an American. Secondly, she was an unmarried woman living in London without any sort of proper chaperone&#x2014;unless one could count a young Indian <i>amah</i> for the two children who traveled with her, which Honoria clearly did not. Thirdly, as Honoria had found out by setting one of her own servants to spy on the house from across the street, Miss Townsend's household consisted of a hodgepodge of people from a variety of countries, including not only the two children whose parent-age was decidedly unclear&#x2014;one of them was American and the other apparently French&#x2014;and the aforementioned Indian girl who cared for the children, but also an African man who wore not the livery of a servant but the suit of a gentleman and who was, according to the gossip Honoria's spy had heard in a nearby pub, Miss Townsend's man of business.</p><p> </p><p>Anthony glanced around him as he waited, taking in the spare yet elegant dï¿½cor. Whatever else could be said about Miss Townsend, her taste was impeccable.</p><p> </p><p>He wondered if the woman was the grasping harpy his older sister had portrayed her as. Honoria was not only given to dramatic excess, she was, in Anthony's opinion, far too protective and clinging where her son was concerned. Edmund had been frail from childhood, given to coughs and catarrh. More than once the doctor had assured Honoria that her beloved son would not last through the winter.</p><p> </p><p>As a result of this&#x2014;and her innate personality&#x2014;Honoria had coddled Edmund all his life, keeping him at home with her until, as a grown man, he had finally insisted on moving to London and living on his own. Even then, Honoria had kept him running to her side for one reason or another, alternating her coddling with pleas for him to help her with this problem or that. She had, Anthony thought, ignored her daughter, Samantha, and her late husband in her obsession with her son&#x2014;which was, he reasoned, probably a good thing as far as the daughter was con-cerned.</p><p> </p><p>Honoria would not easily give up her son to another woman, and Anthony suspected that even a saint would not have earned the elder Lady Scar-brough's approval.</p><p> </p><p>However, he could not dismiss her suggestion out of hand, either. Edmund's title and fortune, while not as great as Anthony's own, were enough to lure any fortune-hunting female. Moreover, given Edmund's frail constitution and the frequency with which he suffered from debilitating fevers and lung ail-ments&#x2014;which Edmund privately feared was deadly co...</p></p><h2>The Doctrine and Covenants: A Book of Answers : The 25th Annual Sidney B.

The book equals Joe Orton&#39;s famous Diaries in providing an unblushing account of a gay lifestyle linked to entertainment. Full of outrageous fictions and touching truths, in telling surreal and outrageous lies Graham Chapman often uncovers a truth about himself and colleagues. The stories Chapman relates--whether as mountaineer or medical student (he was a doctor); actor or alcoholic (he was both); heterosexual groupie-guzzler or homosexual coming to terms with himself (bit of both)--form a surreal and crowded mosaic that is funny, disturbing, and moving by turns.

Rain morning and evening since the beginning of the week.<br><br>He could drive to work, but it was only a couple of miles so he didn't qualify for a college parking permit. He could get a bus, but they were infrequent and unreliable and there was still a ten-minute walk from the stop nearest to his house.<br><br>People were dashing down the steps and out into the downpour. Students crossed the courtyard with anorak hoods pulled over their heads.<br><br>Leslie Blade lifted his umbrella and stepped out.<br><br>Until the last few months he had always followed the same route along the main road and around by the Hill, but now the Old Market Lanes had opened he sometimes walked through them, liking the cobbles and the less garish lights, looking into the windows of the bookshop and a couple of galleries, buying a piece of cheese or some salami from the delicatessen which stayed open until seven. It made him twenty minutes or more later arriving home, which his mother did not like, so he had taken to buying her some chocolate or a bag of butter toffee. It was a bribe, and it wasn't what she really wanted, which was his company, but it worked. She enjoyed the sweets.<br><br>By the time he reached the Lanes this evening, rain was sluicing off the gutters and there were deep puddles at the side of the narrow cobbled way. The deli was closing early.<br><br>He saw her at the end of the Street, where the Lanes decanted onto the market square. She was standing just inside the light that spilled out from the pub, the collar of her jacket up, trying to shelter from the rain but still remain visible. Leslie quickened his step. This was a new place; he had not seen any of them here before. It was too near the main shopping streets and cars were not allowed to stop in the square - only buses, and taxis on their way to the rank at the far end.<br><br>But it was Abi. He was sure it was Abi, even from the other end of the street. Abi or just possibly Marie?<br><br>He skirted one puddle but hit the next and felt the cold water slosh up the front of his leg, soaking his trousers, and he almost fell as he reached the corner.<br><br>"Abi?"<br><br>The young woman did not glance round, but instead went to join the man for whom she had clearly been waiting. Took his arm. Went into the pub.<br><br>Not Abi. Not Marie. Not one of them after all.<br><br>Leslie felt angry and he felt a fool. But there was no one to notice.<br><br>He crossed the market square and headed away from the shops and the lights, towards the Hill.<br>Hilary, his mother's carer, left at four thirty and he tried to get home just after six. Tonight, it was nearer twenty past because the rain driving into his path had slowed him down. It was Thursday, one of his two nights for going out, but if it didn't clear up, he wondered, was there much point? Would any of them be out in weather like this?<br><br>He opened the front door.<br><br>Hilary always left the porch light on for him, the kettle filled and ready. If he wanted her to do anything else, peel potatoes or put something into a low oven, he had only to leave a note and she would do it willingly, though he rarely made any requests. She was his mother's carer, not a domestic help. He and Hilary almost never met, but communicated, if they needed to, by a series of notes - hers always cheerful and decorated with funny faces and little pencilled stars or flowers. He was lucky. He had heard stories of the other sort of carer - the Chief Librarian's secretary had had a few bad experiences with her mother's carers, women who had been brusque or even downright unkind, and one who had been a thief. Hilary was dependable, strong, cheerful, reliable. Leslie knew good luck when it came his way. Norah Blade was not difficult, but rheumatoid arthritis as bad as hers did not make for an even temper.<br><br>"Leslie?"<br><br>"I'm here. But I'm going up to change, I'm soaked."<br><br>"It's poured all day, I've watched it through these windows and it hasn't let up since you went out this morning."<br><br>He could tell everything by her tone of voice. Good day. Bad day. Painful day. She sounded bright. Not a bad day then.<br><br>They could have a nice evening, and she'd be settled in bed before he had to go out. Sometimes, if she was in a lot of pain, he had to stay up with her, play a game of cards, help to make the night a bit shorter. On those evenings he couldn't go.<br><br>The strip light was on above the kitchen worktops, a pan of peeled carrots on the cooker, a chirpy note from Hilary on the pad. He felt better for dry trousers and his slippers, poured himself a lager and checked on the casserole. The curtains were not yet drawn and, as he reached up to close them, he saw that the rain was no longer teeming down the windows and the wind had dropped.<br>"There's nothing much on," Norah said, after they had eaten supper and he had helped her back to her chair.<br><br>She watched quiz games, wildlife and travel programmes, Midsomer Murders and reruns of the gentler comedy series.<br><br>"University Challenge?"<br><br>"They all look so scruffy."<br><br>"Goodness, Mother, you should see some of our students. The ones on television are quite presentable."<br><br>"There was a boy with green hair."<br><br>"That was years ago."<br><br>"All the same."<br><br>They could continue bantering enjoyably in this way on and off until bedtime. It had taken Leslie some years to understand that Norah pretended to be grumpy and dissatisfied about small things - television programmes, the noise the neighbours made, bits and pieces in the local paper - as a safety valve. She was in continuous pain, she was limited in movement, confined to a couple of rooms, and about those things she never complained. Grumbling over the scruffiness of the young on TV was a way of letting out a scream of anguish and misery at her condition.<br><br>So he indulged her, let her grumble on. The actor who played the young detective in Midsomer Murders wasn't as good as his predecessor; some of the wildlife programmes had too much chat from presenters and too little focus on the animals. He was used to it. He didn't mind.<br><br>"Hilary's sister is expecting a baby, did I tell you?"<br><br>"You did. When's it due?"<br><br>"Spring sometime. Ages yet. But of course Hilary's thrilled to bits. They live only a few streets away from her."<br><br>"Yes, you said."<br><br>Norah Blade never spoke a word against her carer and had never fallen out with her, even over something trivial.<br><br>They watched half of a vulgar new sitcom before Norah decided to go to bed.<br><br>"I've got three new library books Hilary changed for me. They can't be worse entertainment than this." She snapped the remote control button and the television died.<br>It was half past nine by the time she was settled. Leslie went into the kitchen and opened the window. He could see a few stars in the clearing sky. He cleared away the supper plates, then took out a fresh sliced loaf, cheese, tomatoes and a pack of ham, made the sandwiches, cut a bought fruit cake into slices and wrapped everything in foil. He put the food into a carrier bag, with half a dozen Mars bars, some apples and a flask of coffee. He always made enough for four, and if there were more, they had to share it.<br><br>He sometimes wondered if Hilary ever saw the large blocks of cheese and packs of butter in the fridge, the chocolate and biscuits in the cupboard, and wondered who ate so much food, and usually overnight; but his mother always said one of the best things about Hilary was that she was never nosy, never commented, waited to be told things and if she was not, did not ask.<br><br>He tidied up, then watched the news headlines. When he switched off the television, the house was very quiet. A car went past. Quiet again. They were at the end of the row, and the neighbours on the other side made little noise. He wondered if Norah might prefer to live in a livelier street, with more families passing by, children going to and from school; she spent a lot of time in her chair by the window. But she had lived in this house for fifty-three years. It had been his home all his life. There was no question of moving now.<br><br>The front room, which had once been the dining room, had been made into a bedroom, now that Norah could no longer climb the stairs; there was a bathroom in a small extension. He went into the hall. There was no light coming from under her door, but he called her name softly a couple of times. Waited. Nothing. He opened the door slightly and stood listening to her soft breathing. The numbers glowed a strange alien green on her radio clock.<br><br>"Goodnight, Mother."<br><br>She did not reply.<br>But ten minutes later, hearing the soft click of the front door closing, Norah Blade opened her eyes. The house was settling back into itself. She listened. Leslie parked his car on the small piece of waste ground between their house and the block of flats. Sometimes she asked him why he bothered to keep it, whether it wasn't too much of an expense, as he didn't use it for work.<br><br>"I take you to the hospital, I use it for shopping, we go out in the summer. You'd miss it."<br><br>"You could hire one."<br><br>"No, once you stop driving regularly you lose the skill."<br><br>But he used it more often than that, Norah knew; he took the car at night, twice a week, though where he went and what he did she did not know nor would she ever ask. He was a grown man. He had a right to a private life. She felt guilty enough.<br><br>She strained her ears waiting until she heard him drive away down the road. The pain was never bad during this early part of the night because she was warm and comfortable propped on her special pillows, and the medication she took with a hot drink blurred the sharp edges for a time. But she never slept until Leslie came in, just lay in the darkness, strangely comforted by the green glow of the bedside clock. He would be out for a couple of hours and when she heard him return, she would fall asleep at...</p><h2>The Other in the Mirror</h2><p>The Other in the Mirror brings together three classic novels by Philip Josï¿½ Farmer: Fire and the Night, Jesus on Mars, and Night of Light. All three are united by one of SF s central tropes, that of The Other.<br><br>Fire and the Night is a mainstream novel so rare that even many of Farmer's most dedicated fans have never read it.

Hired by the galactic Church on a mission to squelch a burgeoning rival religion, Carmody must take the Chance on the planet Dante's Joy and risk his worst nightmares becoming reality.

Melissa Boyle Mahle risked her life working as an undercover CIA field operative in the Middle East until her departure in 2002. She therefore has a unique vantage point from which to view the political and operational culture of the agency in the post&#x2013;Cold War climate. From Reagan to Bush Jr., Mahle provides a vivid personal and historical narrative on how the CIA became an anorexic organization, lost in the post&#x2013;Cold War world. Afraid to take risks that might offend Washington politicos and European allies, gutted of the clandestine operators who knew how to run secret wars, exhausted from reform whiplash, and demoralized by demonization and poor performance, the CIA simply became unable and unwilling &#x201c;to get down and dirty to do the hard part to fight a real war on terrorism.&#x201d; Denial and Deception describes the last generation of the CIA and is a unique contribution to our understanding of the secret world of intelligence.</p><p><br>Melissa Boyle Mahle is a counterterrorism expert who was the top-ranked female Arabist in the CIA when she retired as a covert officer in 2002. She received a letter of appreciation from the President for her work on the Middle East peace process. &nbsp;Since leaving the government, Ms. Mahle has worked as a private consultant on Middle Eastern political and security affairs. She lives in Virginia.A former clandestine agent specializing in the Middle East, Mahle begins with September 11th (she was doing intake on prospective applicants), but the bulk of her work recounts the CIA's involvement in such low watermarks of American intelligence as the Iran-Contra and the Ames affairs, and what she says have been their the devastating internal consequences. This is not just a memoir; Mahle joined the agency in 1988, and she pings back and forth in time, covering events and periods with which she was not directly involved. She decries what she characterizes as indiscriminate Congressional investigations, as well as political pressures to tailor conclusions to the biases of superiors. Both have led, she says, to demoralization and to a serious reduction in the CIA's overall capabilities-with the effects being fully felt now, as the U.S. finds itself in dire need of HUMINT (or human intelligence) from the Middle East and elsewhere. Reading the book is like talking to one of Seymour Hersh's sources, but with the relevance filter off; there's tons of information here-with a good deal on pre- and post-September 11th al-Qaeda-but very few readers will find all of it engaging. Nevertheless, as a major debriefing from an insider, one who writes clearly and often wryly, it succeeds. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <em>Plain Women</em>, Margaret C. Reynolds portrays the women of the Old Order River Brethren, a significant branch of the Brethren in Christ located mainly in Pennsylvania. </p><p>The members of this conservative offshoot of the Brethren are often confused with the Amish because of their plain attire, but, unlike the Amish, they have made some notable concessions to the modern world&#x2014;including the use of automobiles, computers, and home appliances. Noting these accommodations to modern American life, Reynolds examines the ceremonies and traditions that allow the Old Order River Brethren to remain "separate" from other plain groups and from contemporary mass culture. She describes, for example, the love feast communion, a service that involves footwashing and a breadmaking ritual (one unique to the Old Order River Brethren and solely performed by women). Reynolds focuses in particular on the gendered customs of dress, hair, and domesticity that shape women&#x2019;s lives and, in so doing, preserve the minority faith itself. </p><p><em>Plain Women</em> is the first volume in the new Pennsylvania German History and Culture Series, published in cooperation with the Pennsylvania German Society. This series is a continuation of the Society&#x2019;s annual volumes on Pennsylvania German scholarship in disciplines such as history, religion, folklore, literature, and arts.</p></p><p>Margaret C. Reynolds published articles in Pennsylvanio Mennonite Heritage. Pennsylvania Folklife, and Der Reggeboge: Journal of the Pennsylvania German Society before her death in 1997.&#x201c;Written with nuance and insight, <i>Plain Women</i> is a fine and probing analysis of the role of women in the Old Order River Brethren. Reynolds has a firm mastery of the history and doctrines of the background movements of Anabaptism and Pietism, and her findings fill the gaps in published information on this minority faith.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Donald F. Durnbaugh, Juniata College<br><br>&#x201c;Margaret Reynolds shows us the importance of Old Order River Brethren women in the life of the group. In their domestic role of providing nurture in everyday life, and in the religious symbolism permeating their ceremonial preparation of bread for the communion Love Feast, these women act as primary bearers of meaning for the culture.

Intent on embroiling the US in a quagmire that will sap its economy and drain its legitimacy, Russia passes a potential weapon of mass destruction to Boco Haram, an extreme Islamic sect in Nigeria. A relic of the Cold War, the Russian FSB believes the weapon has deteriorated and is no longer effective, but they are wrong. Boco Haram has the means for mass destruction, which will be set loose upon a multitude of unsuspecting innocents on one of the world&#39;s grandest stages. Trying to solve the riddle of who might be stalking them, Pike Logan and the Taskforce have no idea what&#39;s been set in motion; but there&#39;s another secret from the Cold War buried in the Russian FSB, and exposing it will mean the difference between life and death -- not only for Pike and his partner, Jennifer, but for perhaps millions more around the globe.</p><p>BRAD TAYLOR is the New York Times bestselling author of six previous Pike Logan novels.

Why was it that a town predicated on attracting tourists did nothing to help them navigate? The damn place was a maze. And he thought Jerusalem was bad. This town was worse.</p><p>He grinned, knowing that wasn&#x2019;t really true.</p><p>He continued in the same direction, following the crowds walking down the large promenade. He hoped to see something that would trigger in his mind from the research he&#x2019;d conducted before he left Tel Aviv. An historic house, church, mosque, or other landmark he would recognize. He saw a circular hole in the ground, about a hundred feet across, and walked toward it. Getting closer, he sighed with relief, recognizing the remains of an old Roman stadium. Only a small piece had been excavated, with the rest running a hundred meters under the pavement of the modern streets, but it was a landmark he could anchor against.</p><p>He got his bearings and took a left on Saborna Street, entering the cloistered cobblestone of the old city. He picked up his pace, seeing he&#x2019;d burned his entire time cushion wandering around trying to find his location. He passed other tourists out sightseeing, but didn&#x2019;t ask for any help. Very few spoke English, and none spoke Hebrew, but he was fairly sure he could find the remains of the old fortress on the tip of the hill. From there, he&#x2019;d locate the beer garden with the man he was paying to meet.</p><p>They&#x2019;d had some success penetrating Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition forces, but no stone would be left unturned. The Mossad looked everywhere and anywhere for intelligence, and when an oligarch from Russia had made contact, claiming he not only had information on Russian geopolitical history and future goals, but on the Syrian government&#x2019;s intentions with WMD, he&#x2019;d been launched to investigate. The oligarch&#x2014;code-named Boris&#x2014;had picked the place and Israel had brought the money. There was little risk if he ended up being a bust, but the potential for payoff was great.</p><p>Aaron wound his way through the cobblestones, knowing as long as he was headed uphill, he was going in the right direction. He passed a youth hostel, seeing a tent and a clothesline in the courtyard behind an open door, wondering how they washed their clothes before hanging them up. Did they have automated washers, or do it by hand? For that matter, did they have a shower in the compound, or did they simply pay for the security of a lock on the gate?</p><p>He would have liked to experience the world as they did, freely tramping about, no worries and no greater ambition than to explore, but that had been taken from him in the first Intifada when a suicide blast on a Tel Aviv bus had shredded his parents.</p><p>He had been fourteen, and his childhood had disappeared. He had worked to contain his hatred at the same time he had worked to find an outlet. He&#x2019;d shown a fierce drive and an uncommon intelligence during his mandatory military service, striving for and being accepted to an elite Special Forces unit known as Sayeret Shimshon&#x2014;or Samson&#x2014;tasked with clandestine penetration of the Gaza Strip, the hardest counterterrorist missions in the IDF.</p><p>He&#x2019;d learned to blend in as a Palestinian Arab. Learned to harness his fear while walking in the belly of the beast, to succeed against all odds, locating and eliminating terrorists in their own backyard. He&#x2019;d lived through many missions that he would have considered suicidal before, and had had the art of the impossible hammered into him.</p><p>In 1994, right about the time he&#x2019;d begun to grow comfortable with the mission, the Gaza Strip had been given back to the Palestinians, and because of it, his unit had been disbanded. For about a day.</p><p>Before Aaron could even wonder what he would do next, the Mossad had called, wanting Samson&#x2019;s skills and promising future missions.</p><p>Now the commander of the unit, he&#x2019;d made a deal with the devil and found his team doing more Mossad tasks than manhunting. A necessary evil to keep the support. He, as the Samson commander, was not immune, which was why he was in Bulgaria attempting to glean intelligence on Syrian intentions.</p><p>Aaron turned a narrow corner and saw the cobblestone run up to the ruins at the top of the hill. To the right was a smattering of picnic tables perched on an overlook two hundred meters above the town.</p><p>Must be the place.</p><p>He went down the steps, purchased a bottle of Kamenitza beer, then casually surveyed the deck. Full of students and backpackers, he focused on singletons and found his contact fairly quickly. A large, overweight man of about sixty-five or seventy, he was sitting at the very edge of the overlook, next to a small trail leading precipitously down. He had a porkpie hat on the table to his front, and a tourist map laid out. The map was the identifying bona fide, and the hat was the safe signal. Had he been wearing it, Aaron would have taken his beer elsewhere and simply reported back, letting his higher command in Mossad reinitiate contact and determine what had gone wrong.</p><p>Aaron took one more look around the deck, checking for anything out of the ordinary, once again searching for singletons who didn&#x2019;t fit in. He found none, but that didn&#x2019;t mean there was no threat. Just that if there was a threat, it was well trained.</p><p>He approached the man known as Boris and said, &#x201c;Sure is pretty up here.&#x201d;</p><p>The man said, &#x201c;It is, but I prefer Moscow. Have you been there?&#x201d; </p><p>Aaron sat down opposite of him and said, &#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;ve always<br>wanted to go.&#x201d;</p><p>The correct words exchanged, with both men satisfied they were talking to the correct person, Boris wasted no more time.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you bring the money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Well, I brought a card and a PIN. You can draw the money from any ATM or bank, but the card won&#x2019;t be activated until I get what I came for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do I know you aren&#x2019;t tricking me?&#x201d;</p><p>Aaron smiled and said, &#x201c;How do I know you have any information that&#x2019;s worth a shit?&#x201d;</p><p>Boris said, &#x201c;The Americans thought it was good. They have paid me handsomely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already sold this to the CIA?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Perhaps you&#x2019;d like to wait on them to pass it to you.&#x201d; Boris smiled again.</p><p>&#x201c;What am I buying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard about Edward Snowden?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The American traitor? The one who gave all the secrets to you people? Is that what this is about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, I just mean are you aware of the large cache of documents he stole from the American National Security Agency? I am like him. I have a treasure trove of documents, from the KGB&#x2019;s help of terrorists against your state in the 1970s to what they&#x2019;re planning to do today. Russia is worse now than it was under the USSR, and the KGB is alive and well in the FSB.&#x201d;</p><p>Aaron knew that Boris was prior KGB himself, and understood that he&#x2014;like many, many KGB agents&#x2014;had made a fortune plying his skills for less-than-savory individuals before returning to the new federal security apparatus&#x2014;the FSB. He was no saint. No white knight out to expose Russian corruption. No, he&#x2019;d been turned out into the cold for some transgression, and now he was looking for a final golden parachute. An augmentation of his retirement fund to be earned by selling the souls of the people he&#x2019;d worked with for decades. It made the Israeli sick to his stomach.</p><p>Aaron said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just get this done. How do I get the information? You&#x2019;ll earn no money until that happens.&#x201d;</p><p>Boris said. &#x201c;I figured as much, but a man can hope. I didn&#x2019;t bring the information here with me. Bulgaria is easy to get to, but very, very dangerous for me to operate within.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, his teeth cracked and yellow from a lifetime of tobacco. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d walked up with an umbrella, I would have jumped off the cliff. The KGB may be gone, but they can still kill pretty ingeniously.&#x201d; </p><p>Aaron knew he was talking about the death of a Bulgarian dissident named Georgi Markov, assassinated by the Bulgarian secret police in London in 1978. While waiting on a bus, a man had approached and injected a ricin tablet into Markov&#x2019;s leg using a spring-loaded<br>umbrella. Markov had died three days later.</p><p>Aaron said, &#x201c;I have no weapons. I have a card I&#x2019;m willing to activate if you have information.&#x201d;</p><p>Boris nodded and said, &#x201c;Taped underneath my chair is a key. It opens a lockbox held by a man at an Internet cafï¿½ in the main bus station in Istanbul. He&#x2019;s waiting for you. You give him the key, and he&#x2019;ll call me. You&#x2019;ll give me the PIN to the card, and I&#x2019;ll have him pass you the thumb drive. I get the PIN and I&#x2019;ll give you the password to the encryption. Fair enough?&#x201d;</p><p>Aaron started to reply when Boris slapped his chest with both hands, his eyes squeezed shut in pain before popping open wide in shock. He swayed a minute, then fell out of his chair. Aaron raced around the table and grabbed his shoulders. &#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>Boris said, &#x201c;Heart. Heart. Pacemaker. Stop . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Aaron propped him up with one hand while sweeping his other under the chair, retrieving the key. He cloaked the movement by shouting, &#x201c;Is there a doctor here? Anyone have medical training?&#x201d;</p><p>A crowd had gathered, but nobody moved forward. Aaron looked into Boris&#x2019;s face and saw his eyes go flat. Something he&#x2019;d seen many, many times.</p><p>Boris was dead.<br></p><p> <br><b>4</b></p><p><br>Yuri Gorshenko watched from the rear of the crowd, gawking like the rest of the people at the dead Russian. Finally, two men pushed through the throng, ostensibly some sort of medical team. He saw the Israeli stand up and fade to the back. Yuri waited until he had disappeared from view before leaving himself.</p><p>Figuring the Israeli would take the shortest route out of the old town, Yuri kept to the high ground, circling the ancient cobblestoned streets until he was standing next to a Roman theater from eons ago, now equipped with modern sound and advertising contemporary shows. He found a small table in the sun and sat down, giving the Israeli time to clear the area. Killing time, he fiddled with an electronic device, checking the readout for a sniff of a vulnerability, but it came up empty.</p><p>No pacemakers around here.</p><p>Looking like a scientific calculator with an antennae, he marveled at how quickly it had worked. He&#x2019;d practiced with it endlessly, but had never used it live.</p><p>Worth the risk going to San Francisco.</p><p>The device was nothing but a bunch of plastic and silicon, harnessed together like any other modern gadget, from a Nintendo portable game player to a digital cell phone. The difference was its purpose. There would be no joy working this device, unless one liked watching people die. Using a wireless connection, it injected malware into implanted medical devices. In plain language, it caused pacemakers to flame out with eight hundred volts.</p><p>The vulnerability had been perfected by the FSB over two years ago, and had been used quite successfully until the back door had been discovered by an American hacker named Barnaby Jack. Last year, he was all set to reveal what he&#x2019;d found at a hacking conference called Black Hat when the FSB had intervened. They&#x2019;d spent too much time and effort refining their technique to allow their back door to be exposed, and so they&#x2019;d decided the risk of operating in the United States was worth it. Barnaby Jack died under &#x201c;mysterious&#x201d; circumstances in San Francisco, causing a mountain of conspiracy theories, but none as outlandish as the truth.</p><p>Yuri checked his watch, seeing thirty minutes had passed. He had about forty-five minutes before he had to report to his Control, something he didn&#x2019;t want to be late for. He stood up and walked around the outskirts of the theater, then followed the cobblestones downhill until he intersected Knyaz Aleksandar Street. He blended into the crowds out shopping, and wandered south, past the ugly Communist-era post office, the building blanketed with graffiti.</p><p>The supposed benefits of capitalism.</p><p>Yuri passed behind the post office and turned right, walking toward another squat, ugly four-story building at the edge of a large wooded park. The location of his Control, it was a Communist-era military club, still used by the old Bulgarian military men. A sort of veteran&#x2019;s affairs association from the USSR of the past.</p><p>He entered, seeing a geriatric man guarding the front door, the room inside paneled in old wood, dark and dank. In Bulgarian, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jarilo. Someone is here to meet me.&#x201d;</p><p>The man showed nothing but boredom, having seen and heard many odd things in his eight decades of life. He nodded and said, &#x201c;Upstairs. Last room.&#x201d;</p><p>Yuri turned without a word and walked across the open ballroom, his feet clacking on the marble floor. He entered the stairwell and climbed to the top, his steps now causing echoes that bounced back and forth in the narrow confines.</p><p>The clatter stopped in the hallway, his footfalls smothered by the threadbare carpeting, something he was sure was left over from the Bulgarian revolution.</p><p>From the thirteenth century.</p><p>He found the last door and paused, checking his clothing to ensure he projected a professional appearance. He had nothing but disdain for Control, as the man had never entered the arena&#x2014;never risked his life in the great game&#x2014;but he did outrank Yuri and was someone who could affect his career.</p><p>Yuri knocked, heard a muffled &#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; and opened the door. What he saw on the other side rendered him speechless.</p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Mauritius Reunion &amp; Seychelles (Multi Country Travel Guide)</h2><p>Paradise on earth? Pretty close.

Selected from thirty years of her work, and including some of her haunting photography, this book creates a portrait of a life lived under duress, a voice in danger of being silenced, and a spirit that is shaken but so far indomitable. Liu Xia's poems are potent, acute moments of inquiry that peel back to expose the fraught complexity of an interior world. They are felt and insightful, colored through with political constraints even as they seep beyond those constraints and toward love.</p></p><p><b>Liu Xia</b> is a Chinese poet and artist. English translations of her poetry by Ming Di and Jennifer Stern have been published by PEN America, Chinese PEN, the BBC, <i>The Guardian</i>, the Margins for the Asian American Writers' Workshop, <i>Poetry</i>, the Poetry Society of America, and Words Without Borders. Liu Xia's photographs have appeared in galleries throughout the world. She has been living under strict house arrest since her husband, the poet and activist Liu Xiaobo, was imprisoned in 2009 for "inciting subversion of state power" and then received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.<p>&#x201c;A testament to the human spirit when that spirit is confined. . . .

Courage and dignity are the primary elements of these songs of rebellion where love conquers the isolation of imprisonment.

But as a tree she still sings the songs of birds. When a bird is dying, her singing is sorrowful. These are the only songs, the dying songs, of Chinese poetry since June 4, 1989.

But since our mother married her father, we're stuck with her...our "poor stepsister" who lost her real mother in a mysterious fire. </p> <p> But now something terrible has happened. Heather has found a new friend, out in the graveyard behind our home -- a girl named Helen who died with her family in a mysterious fire over a hundred years ago. Now her ghost returns to lure children into the pond...to drown! I don't want to believe in ghosts, but I've followed Heather into the graveyard and watch her talk to Helen. And I'm terrified. Not for myself, but for Heather... </p></p><p>Mary Downing Hahn, a former children&#39;s librarian, is the award-winning author of many popular ghost stories, including Deep and Dark and Dangerous and The Old Willis Place. An avid reader, traveler, and all-around arts lover, Ms. Hahn lives in Columbia, Maryland, with her two cats, Oscar and Rufus.Molly and Michael have a difficult time adjusting to their spoiled new stepsister, Heather. Ellen Grafton perfectly captures the selfish, manipulative Heather and the disgusted responses of her stepsiblings. Their parents, hopeful that the family will come together with a move to the country, find a home next to a graveyard--a graveyard with a ghost who leads young girls into a watery grave. As Heather fights to pull the family apart and makes an alliance with the ghost, Grafton&#39;s reading hints at her inner struggle. The strength of Grafton&#39;s narration is the power she gives to the many strained family interactions. These create a listening tension that mounts to a taut conclusion as Molly fights to save the tormented Heather from the ghost.

Here, every autumn, a miracle happens-for Isabel&#39;s tree is the wintering place for thousands upon thousands of monarch butterflies that migrate from the north. When they flutter down to roost, they transform Isabel&#39;s tree into La casa de las mariposas-The House of Butterflies. But this wonder is in danger of disappearing forever. Isabel&#39;s family is poor, and it is a cruel, dry year for Papa&#39;s meager crop of corn and beans. Soon, chopping down the tree to sell its wood may be the family&#39;s only hope for survival. What will happen to the butterflies then? Tony Johnston&#39;s poignant tale, as brief and luminous as the lives of the butterflies themselves, is all the more compelling because of the real-life dilemma it presents. Lush paintings by Susan Guevara radiate with the warmth and tenderness between Isabel and her family, and capture Mexican rural life in all its vibrant color and natural beauty.</p><p>Outside her home Michoacan, Mexico, grows eight-year-old Isabel&#39;s greatest treasure: any oyamel tree.

The queen, priestess of the sun-god, Dushrat, calls on demonic powers in her quest, but Cassia is prepared for the fierce spiritual battle to save her son, joining a Roman named Julian and his community of believers in the Jewish Messiah.

Growing up in a small town in Germany certainly didn&#x2019;t prepare her for superstardom. After winning a national modeling contest she had entered on a lark, Heidi spent the next two years trying to catch a break in a business dominated by skinny waifs and big egos. Ignoring the skeptics and naysayers, at nineteen, she hopped a plane to the United States, where she tirelessly (and always optimistically) posed, strutted, networked, and laughed her way to the top.<br>Heidi learned a lot on the road to becoming a cultural icon&#x2014;and fortunately she took notes along the way. In this funny, dishy, and highly practical book, she shares the secrets behind her success and shows how anyone can achieve their goals in work, love, and life:<br><br>ï¿½ Pursue success long after any sane person would have given up<br>ï¿½ Persuade others you have the chops to do whatever it is you&#x2019;re going for<br>ï¿½ Make people see you as you want to be seen<br>ï¿½ Find your own unique style<br>ï¿½ Create a strong, healthy body<br>ï¿½ Tap into your seductive side<br>ï¿½ Broaden your horizons by traveling the world<br>ï¿½ Have a blast while it lasts<br><br>This informative romp is full of gorgeous photos from the top professional photographers in the fashion industry, personal pictures from Heidi&#x2019;s own scrapbooks, behind-the-scenes stories about the modeling world, and helpful hints for achieving success. With her refreshing candor and effervescent style, Heidi offers dead-on advice that will resonate with anyone who has ever wanted more out of life.</p><p>HEIDI KLUM is an internationally recognized model who has been featured in many top fashion magazines and prestigious campaigns, including a long-running association with Victoria&#x2019;s Secret. Her career has also branched out to encompass numerous creative and business ventures, including fine jewelry, perfume, shoe, swimwear, and clothing lines. Heidi has also acted in and hosted many film and television projects. She lives in New York City. You can visit Heidi at www.heidiklum.com.For this self-help book covering everything from health to work to sex, the supermodel best known as the face of Victoria&#x2019;s Secret attempts to advise readers about their lives by explaining how she handled tricky situations in her own life. But Klum&#x2019;s experiences, which range from watching the U.S. Open with Donald Trump to chatting awkwardly with Prince backstage at the Tonight Show, will be difficult for the average person to relate to. The basis for Klum&#x2019;s "rules," such as "You Have to Want It, Baby (Desire)," "Be a Jet-Setter (Travel)" and "Make a Fashion Statement (Statement)," are certainly admirable. But Klum doesn&#x2019;t explicate them nearly as much as she writes about her own life, making this book feel more like an authorized biography. Several celebrities Klum counts as friends provide interesting sidebars: Harvey Weinstein on how to break into the entertainment business, Michael J. Fox on how to find humor in any situation, etc. Klum&#x2019;s fans will want the book for its photos alone, which include the infamous snapshot of her biting Evander Holyfield&#x2019;s ear and a 43-page portfolio of her personal favorites. There are more practical self-help books on the shelves, but none have such beautiful photos and as many pages of fodder for celebrity enthusiasts.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is not just a list of questions followed by the answers. Readers are given three sets of clues to help them name the ballplayer in question. If they get the player on the first clue, they are awarded five points. If they require a second clue, they get only three points. And if they need the final clue they're still rewarded, but with only one point. Not only are the clues given in "tiers," but the book's four chapters run from extremely easy (e.g., identifying the likes of Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron) to much more obscure (where was Mickey Mantle born? what do you remember about Johnny Bench?).</p><p>Wayne Stewart has been a professional sportswriter for more than thirty-five years and has authored thirty books, including Name that Ballplayer, You&#x2019; re the Umpire, and The Little Giant Book of Basketball Facts.</p><h2>And You Shall Know Us by the Trail of Our Vinyl:The Jewish Past as Told by the Records We Have Loved</h2><p>What started out as a mutual affinity for kitschy Jewish album covers&#x2013;think Neil Diamond baring his chest hair on the cover of <i>Hot August Night </i>or Barbra Streisand in hot pants on the cover of <i>Streisand Superman</i>&#x2013;soon became a quest for identity, history, and culture between the grooves of LPs.<br><br>Together, Roger Bennett and Josh Kun embarked on a thrilling journey, scouring the world to collect thousands of vinyl LPs from attics, garage sales, and dusty archives.

You re not alone. The Bible contains more than a few hard sayings (John 6:60): ancient idioms, apparent contradictions, myth-like events and figures, and passages that seem to be embarrassingly out of step with modern culture or science. Trent Horn can help. In Hard Sayings, Trent looks at dozens of the most confounding passages in Scripture and offers clear, reasonable, and Catholic keys to unlocking their true meaning.</p><p>After his conversion to the Catholic faith, Trent Horn pursued an undergraduate degree in history from Arizona State University. He then earned a graduate degree in theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville and is currently pursuing a graduate degree in philosophy from Holy Apostles College. Trent is a regular guest on the radio program Catholic Answers Live, a lecturer who speaks across the country on issues related to the Catholic faith, and the author of two books, Answering Atheism and Persuasive Pro-life, both of which are published by Catholic Answers Press.What a desperately needed book! Whether you're a skeptic who thinks the 'dark passages' disprove God, or a faithful Catholic who trusts the Bible but still has a hard time swallowing these verses, this book is a light switch to cast away those shadows. --Brandon Vogt, Content Director at Word on Fire, author of RETURN: How to Draw Your Child Back to the Church<br><br>The Bible is the written Word of God. But it is not always easy to understand. As with many things in a fallen world, difficulties arise. Trent Horn masterfully aids readers in overcoming these difficulties by answering objections to key passages and ideas of the Bible. This book is a helpful, popular tool for apologists, evangelists, and ordinary believers. --Mark Brumley- author, apologist, Pres of Ignatius Press<br><br>Horn's arguments are clear and concise, drawing widely from the best of current scholarship to address the Bible s most difficult passages. More impressively still, he manages to make this content accessible to the ordinary believer while not oversimplifying the issues involved. --Matthew J. Ramage, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Theology at Benedictine College, Author of Dark Passages of the Bible</p><h2>Ecology As Politics</h2><p>Andre Gorz, to my mind the greatest of modern French social thinkers, dares to venture where no one really has before. Fighters for democratic socialism and an ecological society have each recognized the handwriting on the wall: modern society cannot continue on its present path. Neither group, however, has even begun to recognize the other&#39;s value, beyond being little more than a tactical means towards achieving their own ends. Gorz, in this exciting and penetrating gem of a book, addresses precisely this question, and offers a connection between the political and the ecological.In an age of crisis the realist becomes visionary and the visionary the rational architect of the future. Andre Gorz is just that. The present decade will be a debacle for progressive change unless our creative efforts move towards linking our concerns with the quality of life to those of economic and political structure. Andre Gorz, as this little volume bears witness, has taken up where Herbert Marcuse left off. &#39;The only things worthy of each,&#39; Gorz says, &#39;are those which are good for all.&#39; This book is worthy indeed of each.</p><p>Andre Gorz was one of Europe&#39;s leading thinkers on politics. He is the author of several books including Ecology as Politics and Paths to Paradise.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Living in Argentina</h2><p>Argentina considers itself the most European of South American countries, and with good reason.

As a child, she struggled with reading and writing. But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.</p><p>Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!</p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. <em>Dear Mr. Henshaw</em> won the Newbery Medal, and <em>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</em> and <em>Ramona and Her Father</em> have been named Newbery Honor Books. Her characters, including Beezus and Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ralph, the motorcycle-riding mouse, have delighted children for generations.</p></p><h2>Breaking Up Is Hard to Do</h2><p>Julie Stillwell and Sean Manning find themselves in love with the wrong people, until they finally meet each other</p><p>Grade 7-9 The romances of two couples, one in New York, the other in New Jersey, are followed in parallel plots that are presented in alternate chapters: high-school students meet, fall in love, and ultimately break up. The heartbroken boy and the girl who were rejected accidently meet in New York City in the last chapter and are instantly attracted to each other. Thus the twin story lines are woven into one ending. A message that permeates this book, as both couples engage in sex, is that ``making love'' is fine as long as the participants are in love. The triteness of the story is somewhat ameliorated by the use of the parallel plots. The dialogue and narrative are fast moving, with few subtleties to slow the story down. Similar in style to the Harts' Waiting Games (1981) and Sooner or Later (1978, both Avon) , this novel should be as popular with the junior high set as the previous two. Janet E.

He is a winner of the New England Booksellers Association/NEBA Award for Best Fiction. -- the first time a writer of crime literature was so honored. His Joe Gunther detective series is one of the most enduring and critically acclaimed police procedural series being written today.Mayor delivers the strongest entry yet in his Joe Gunther series (after 2003's <i>Gatekeeper</i>) with this complex mystery tied to Gunther's personal life. Thirty-two years earlier, with his wife dying of cancer, a distracted Gunther allowed the investigation of a shopkeeper's murder to go cold. A new crime may be tied to it when a woman shoots her ex-husband with a gun the cops trace to the decades-old unsolved killing. Although it isn't Gunther's case now, he determines to find the link between the past and present crimes, in order to understand his younger self and the unresolved traumas of his early marriage and career. Gunther is an intuitive detective, and it's a treat to follow him as he analyzes subtle clues and teases leads from the unwilling or unwitting. He also must examine his relationship with his longtime lover, Gail Zigman, who's running for the state senate, when he discovers her opponent is backed by a suspect. A Vermont assistant medical examiner, Mayor delights in shedding new light on old evidence using modern forensic techniques that help Gunther solve this labyrinthine case. This is the prolific Mayor's most accomplished book&#x2014;a character-driven novel that's enhanced by graceful prose and a compelling narrative. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A Violin (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. Ten instruments take their parts one by one in a musical performance.</p><p>"The STRINGS all soar, the REEDS implore, / The BRASSES roar with notes galore. / It's music that we all adore. / It's what we go to concerts for." In this exuberant tribute to classical music and the passionate, eccentric musicians who play it, author Lloyd Moss begins with the mournful moan and silken tone of one trombone. A trumpet sings and stings along, forming a duo, then a fine French horn joins in, "TWO, now THREE-O, what a TRIO!" The mellow cello ups it to a quartet, then ZIN! ZIN! ZIN! a violin soars high and moves in to make a quintet. The flute that "sends our soul a-shiver" makes a sextet, and "with steely keys that softly click," a sleek, black, woody clarinet slips the group into a septet. We move on! A chamber group of ten! And the orchestra is ready to begin. Moss should be congratulated for creating a playful, musical stream of rhyming couplets that seamlessly, slyly teaches the names of myriad musical groups. Marjorie Priceman, the whimsical, masterful illustrator of Elsa Okon Rael's <i>When Zaydeh Danced on Eldridge Street</i> and Jack Prelutsky's <i>For Laughing Out Loud</i>, won a Caldecott Honor Award for this swirling, twirling, colorful musical world worthy of thunderous applause and a standing ovation.

In the group are two female political operatives who worked behind the scenes along with four female journalists who also occasionally worked within government to advance women&#x2019;s rights during the 1950s through the 1970s. Much of it centers on Washington, D.C., as well as the more unlikely cities of Madison, Wisconsin and Miami, Florida. It includes the story of a women&#x2019;s page journalist who published an official government report in her newspaper section when the White House refused to release it. This book documents the stories of women who organized to help gain employment for other women and also worked to raise the stature of homemakers. Numerous other issues for women were also addressed. The fight for equality became more visible in the 1960s although the foundation had been laid as early as the 1950s, fueled by the post-World War II era. Change was initiated by a mix of women in government and women in the news media &#x2013; at times going back and forth in those positions. These particular women were chosen because of their interactions with each other as they rallied around a common cause and because their names were overshadowed by other women&#x2019;s liberation leaders. It is not meant to be an exhaustive story of the fight for women&#x2019;s rights but rather an addition to the great memoirs and scholarship that already exist.</p><p>Kimberly Wilmot Voss is professor of journalism at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.Kimberly Wilmot Voss has taken up [Laurel Thatcher] Ulrich&#x2019;s challenge to look beyond the &#x201c;exceptional women of history&#x201d; (feminist iconoclasts like Betty Friedan) and delve into lesser-known sources to uncover the compelling stories of well-behaved women whose stories and contributions remain largely invisible. . . . Voss provides fascinating glimpses into the women&#x2019;s personal and professional lives, thanks to extensive research in the women&#x2019;s collected papers. (<i>Missouri Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Richly researched, this book accomplishes three critical goals. First, it introduces us to extraordinary women whose names are lost in the narrative of Second Wave feminism. Second, she reveals that &#x201c;ladies who lunch&#x201d; can also be &#x201c;ladies who launch&#x201d; meaningful challenges to patriarchy. Third, and perhaps most importantly, she expands the notion of activism to include everything from clubs to cookbooks. . . . Considering the void this book fills in the study of gender, it would be useful to any history or sociological course related to feminism, journalism, social movements, and activism. It helps to complete the picture of what a feminist &#x201c;looks like.&#x201d;. . . A goal for historians who study women is to generate a more robust, complete, and inclusive narrative of the role of women in society. Voss accomplishes this and more. She not only adds to the narrative, she also changes the picture of feminism to include [in her words], &#x201c;all of the important, well-behaved women who still need to be a part of the historical record." (<i>INSIGHTS</i>)<br><br>It is important to know how history influences what we do today. Dr. Voss takes us back to the 1960s and 70s, the era of NOW, the ERA and women&#x2019;s liberation, when women were fighting for their rights, and tells the stories of six women who became change agents, particularly in the evolution of women and the media. She presents a wonderful picture of the times and captures the spirit of the women who changed how and by whom information important to women was disseminated. This was an important time in history, one of great social change and one this book brings to life. (Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, Florida International University)<br><br>In Women Politicking Politely, Dr. Voss not only recovers the lives of six important American women but also illuminates the complicated dynamics of social movements. Historians tend to give outsized attention to outspoken protesters, while overlooking those equally important advocates who do the vital work of documenting, publicizing, fund-raising, and pressuring politicians directly. Voss&#x2019;s exploration of these understudied &#x201c;well behaved&#x201d; women&#x2014;four journalists and two government operatives&#x2014;who moved feminism forward rebalances the history of the 1960s and 1970s. Women Politicking Politely is an important contribution to our understanding of the American feminist movement, social movements in general, and the nature of historical memory.

The author specifically examines and explains the Maya spiritual view of the cosmos; their myths and legends; attitudes toward death, suffering and joy; the Path of Beauty; their insights into love, sacrifice and ecstasy, and the attainment of eternal life. He also presents their compelling view of imminent changes in the millennium. Within each chapter, the author includes direct quotes and retellings of the ancient Maya myths, reflects on the encoded messages of sculptures, ruins, ceramics, and paintings, and compares and contrasts this spirituality with the Judeo-Christian spirituality and other world traditions. <i>The Shaman's Secret</i> offers ways to embrace Maya mythic systems to help readers further their own spirituality, and broaden and deepen their experience of spiritual ecstasy.</p><p>Douglas Gillette takes the reader on a journey of discovery, not just of ancient architecture and artifacts, but of lost instructions for the transformation of the human being into an enduring spirit beyond the reach of death. He explores the beauty of the Maya milieu, but does not shy away from the shadowy side of this world. We get the big picture with profound clarity, and the ultimate portrayal of &#34;new ways to destroy death and live forever.&#34;Mythologist Gillette has written with Robert Moore, a Jungian psychologist and cofounder of the men's movement, a number of popular books about applying the wisdom embedded in myths to daily life. Here Gillette solos to report on the discoveries he has made over the course of a lifetime study of ancient Mayan culture, concerning what he terms "resurrection teachings," that is, the efforts of Mayan shamans to transform "the human soul into a durable being capable of defeating death and embracing immortality." Most contemporary seekers consider ancient Mayan spirituality too frightening and disturbing to be a source of enlightenment, but Gillette argues convincingly that the Mayans' "cosmic duality," the recognition that good and evil, creation and destruction, are inextricably connected, provides a firm foundation for spiritual growth. An accessible and engaging writer, Gillette describes the context in which human sacrifice took place, interprets Mayan symbols, explains the role of the shaman, and expounds upon how the study of ancient Mayan beliefs broadens our understanding of the divine. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Little Girl Lost: A Lucy Black Thriller (Lucy Black Thrillers, 1)</h2><p><p>This <em>New York Times</em> bestseller is perfect for fans of Tana French and Dennis Lehane.</p><p>Midwinter.

Frank connects the downswings or crises in accumulation to the changing leadership positions as they shifted from Italy to Spain and Portugal and then to Holland and Britain. He devotes particular attention to the successive incorporation into the single world system of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, whose economies and societies were transformed to contribute to the accumulation of capital in Western Europe and later in North America through exploitation, dependence, and unequal exchange.</p><p>Andre Gunder Frank, of the University of Toronto, has published more than thirty books.

Huizenga fuses the most banal aspects of modern culture with its most looming questions in a consistently genial style. Lighthearted, but with a healthy dose of nineteenth-century spine tingling, the narratives presented in <i>Curses </i>are insightful portrayals of reality. Huizenga's central character in his comics is Glenn Ganges, a seemingly middle-class man living in the suburbs whose blank-eyed wonderment at everyday experiences brings together such diverse aspects of our world as golf, theology, late-night diners, parenthood, politics, Sudanese refugees, and hallucinatory vision, into a complete experience as multifaceted as our own lives.</p><p>Huizenga is regarded by many as one of the most promising young cartoonists of his generation, whose artistic talent, singular writing, and studied substance prove the versatility of his skill. <i>Curses </i>collects his work from <i>Kramer's Ergot </i>and <i>The Drawn &amp; Quarterly Showcase</i>, his award-winning and nominated comic-book series <i>Or Else</i>, and <i>Time </i>magazine; it is the most extensive selection of his comics to date in a single volume.</p></p><p><p><b>KEVIN HUIZENGA</b> has been nominated for both the Harvey and Eisner Awards and is the winner of the Ignatz Award for his short stories and comic books. This is his first graphic novel. He lives in St. Louis, Missouri.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Huizenga has created some of the most remarkable comics of recent years, and this volume collects stories published in anthologies and random comic books. Huizenga's work, drawn in a deceptively simple and quietly expressive cartoon line, is marked by a focus on philosophical quandaries. Nearly all of his stories take place in an anonymous suburbia, and his everyman protagonist, Glenn Ganges, is a likable character possessed of a Charlie Brown&#x2013;like calm. The strongest story in this book, "28th Street," is a fanciful meditation on fertility in which Ganges turns to supernatural solutions for his all too corporeal problems. Another excellent story, "Jeepers Jacobs," explores the nature of heaven and hell through the fictionalized work of a theologian protagonist. Another story, "Green Tea," is an adaptation of a 19th-century thriller. It's quite a range, and Ganges's thoughtful wonderment at all of his experiences opens up the world to the reader. Huizenga is an inclusive, empathic artist who communicates without lectures&#x2014;rather, he simply shows the world as it might be and allows us, through Ganges, to experience it with him. His excellent ear for dialogue and measured prose style accomplish this without flash. These are wonderfully considered, profound comics. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet in the 20th century it played host to three passionate and unconventional women who would take the city by storm. The staggeringly wealthy Marchesa Luisa Casati made her new home a belle epoque aesthete s fantasy and herself a living work of art; notorious British socialite Doris Castlerosse (ne Delevingne) welcomed film stars and royalty to glittering parties between the wars; and American heiress Peggy Guggenheim amassed an exquisite collection of modern art, which today draws visitors from around the world. Each in turn used the Unfinished Palazzo as a stage on which to re-fashion her life, with a dazzling supporting cast ranging from D Annunzio and Nijinsky, through Nol Coward, Winston Churchill and Cecil Beaton, to Yoko Ono. Individually sensational and collectively remarkable, these stories of modern Venice tell us much about the ways women chose to live in the 20th century.</p><p></p><h2>Silver Surfer: Requiem</h2><p>As the substance that protects him from the vacuum of space decays and he faces the inevitability of his own imminent demise, the Silver Surfer makes a last tour of the galaxy and the friends he has made throughout his career.</p><p></p><h2>The Burning Girl</h2><p><blockquote><p>Once burned . . .</p><p>By rights, the horrific schoolyard crime should have been laid to rest twenty years ago. An alleged perpetrator confessed and now is growing old behind bars. But the case still haunts ex-Detective Chief Inspector Carol Chamberlain -- and she has asked DI Tom Thorne to uncover a disturbing truth that lies buried in the ashes.</p></blockquote><p>A series of brutal gangland slayings -- each victim found with an X gouged into his back -- has Thorne plunging into the fires of a deadly turf war, as he attempts to tie together the threads of perplexing crimes separated by decades. But time is rapidly running out in his search for a copycat who revels in blood and pain -- because the body count keeps rising . . . and someone has carved an X into Tom Thorne's front door.</p></p><p>A contract killer is carving his way through North London's criminal underworld, leaving a bloody X on his victims' backs and taking Billy Ryan's gang down one thug at a time. Detective Inspector Tom Thorne and his team know there's a turf war going on, but who's attempting to take over Ryan's racket isn't quite clear. When DCI Carol Chamberlin comes out of retirement to work on the cold case squad and asks Thorne for help solving an old murder, the past and present catch up in what looks like a continuation of a twenty-year-old gang war. And when someone carves an X in Thorne's door, a fuse is lit that stretches from the eponymous burning girl of the title--Chamberlin's old case--to the gang war that's lighting up the London sky. It's a clunky plot that relies on telling more than showing, slowing down the pace and makeing it difficult for the reader to care about any of the principals involved--either the victims or those who seek justic for them.

By the authors of The King Within. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Like the two previous volumes from these collaborators (The King Within and The Warrior Within, both 1992), this one urges men to take control of their lives and to enjoy the knowledge within, in this case by emphasizing mastery of the culture's power, imagination, and technology--a stimulating prospect undermined by graceless writing. Following an explanatory tour of the masculine soul, gender identity, and the male psyche (familiar from earlier works), Moore and Gillette consider traditional images of masculine magicians and the elements most common to their stories--mysterious origins, imperiled infancies, distant wanderings, etc. It's an informed set of observations, and, in tracking the shaman idea through myth and history, the authors support their argument with diverting examples and a well-honed point of view (for example, preferring the terms ``ordinary'' and ``extraordinary'' to the classic ``profane'' and ``sacred''). The role of elders, the importance of ritual, and the significance of initiations are also examined, as are the behaviors of men who fail to measure up--those innocent of the pain they cause, or those detached from their best impulses. By contrast, those who harness the magician's energy--who have access to inner truths and can affirm others' efforts to do the same--are able to ``face the cosmos,'' to live ``as mature men, consciously and intentionally, and with deep self-reflection.'' Would that the authors' presentation were as strong as their conviction. Like its predecessors, the book is full of cumbersome schemata (seven states of initiation, five stages to accessing the magician) and difficult definitions (the difference between ``liminal'' and ``liminoid'') that clog the prose and obscure the message about men's potential--a vital message that needs a simpler idiom to reach its audience. (Fifty b&amp;w photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Drawing on Jungian psychology, theology and folklore, Moore, who teaches at the Chicago Theological Seminary, and pastoral counselor Gillette, coauthors of The King Within and The Warrior Within , advise men on how to nurture the powerful, generative and healing aspect of their natures called the Magician. Along the way men will meet the Trickster, whose manipulative, detached and destructive capacities represent the Magician in his "shadow" or negative form. Through meditation and self-reflection, men can transform the Trickster's negative energy into life-affirming, shamanistic power, according to the authors. Of the book's four parts, the first three examine the archetypes and shadow forms of the male psyche, while the fourth provides a blueprint for individuals hoping to explore the Magician and Trickster figures in their inner lives. This otherwise thoughtful self-help book is marred by psychological jargon and a reliance on spiritualism and rituals as techniques.

He trained as an economist and has lived for several years each in England, California, China and India. He is the author of A Suitable Boy, which was an international number one bestseller, An Equal Music and several other novels. He has also written five volumes of poetry including Beastly Tales.Set in newly independent India, Nehru's early 1950's, this adipose saga counterbalances a book of social manners--the marrying off of a well-to-do educated young woman, Lata Mehra--with a historical account (even at the level of transcribed parliamentary debate) of the subcontinent trying to find its societal bearings vis-...-vis language, religion, and the redistribution of estate-lands taken off the hands of the elite. Set mainly in Brahmpur, the story encompasses four well-off families, with a focus mostly on the younger members--poets, academics, playboys, newlyweds--who stitch a pattern of peccadillo through their elders' expectations. Meanwhile, Seth, whose California novel in verse, The Golden Gate (1986), was clever and energetic in concept but dull and soapy in final effect, falls into the same trap here: lots of stuff obviously--at a marathon 1300-plus pages--but characters made out of clich&#x201a;, with background-India the very stuffed pillow of local color that keeps them standing. The book, too, fairly squeaks with its own pleasure in itself, larded with poetry and a general recommendation of art over politics and money: the characters it spends the most time over are narcissists. Anyone wanting to read how a marriageable daughter can X-ray a whole society ought to let this cream-puff-wrapped-in-a-cinder-block pass and return to Tanizaki's classic Japanese masterpiece, The Makioka Sisters.

Philip Davies suggests a different way of defining the problem of "reliability" and "historicity" by employing the theory of cultural memory.

Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, reflects on his job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four years before: "I have spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the correct waiting time; but there is nothing." The father of two, Behrani has spent most of the money he brought with him from Iran on an apartment and furnishings that are too expensive, desperately trying to keep up appearances in order to enhance his daughter's chances of making a good marriage. Now the daughter is married, and on impulse he sinks his remaining funds into a house he buys at auction, thus unwittingly putting himself and his family on a trajectory to disaster. The house, it seems, once belonged to Kathy Nicolo, a self-destructive alcoholic who wants it back. What starts out as a legal tussle soon escalates into a personal confrontation--with dire results. <p> Dubus tells his tragic tale from the viewpoints of the two main adversaries, Behrani and Kathy. To both of them, the house represents something more than just a place to live. For the colonel, it is a foot in the door of the American dream; for Kathy, a reminder of a kinder, gentler past.

Hurok Presents, 1953). Robinson (Sergei Prokofiev, 1987) wants to show a lonely, self-important man: Hurok's family life as pictured here was notable for the distance Hurok kept from wives (the first was discarded for being too ``old country'') and daughter (Isaac Stern seems the only friend who really liked Hurok). But no one can dispute the career: the ``humble boyhood in the oppressed Old Country,'' as Hurok portrayed it, through ``enterprising youth in opportunity-rich America, prosperous and useful adulthood.'' Hurok started out in the 1920's as a ballet presenter to an uninitiated US public. Anna Pavlova was one of his first big artists, and Robinson interjects his own prejudices into that relationship: ``that a deeply spiritual, frequently prudish, and rigorously circumspect woman like Pavlova would ever have entered into a sexual liaison with a squat, ill-spoken, and nearly illiterate Jewish immigrant like Hurok seems highly improbable.'' Robinson follows Hurok's development as a musical presenter even as his ballet work floundered--his total dismissal of American dance led to ongoing feuds with Agnes de Mille and Lucia Chase. Robinson seems reluctant to give Hurok credit (indeed, he often doesn't seem to like his subject), but he does admire the publicity and pressure tactics leading to Marian Anderson's historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial. Hurok's last big triumph was importing Soviet acts during the cold war; it led, however, to the 1972 bombing of his New York office by the Jewish Defense League: friends and associates agreed that this was the beginning of Hurok's physical decline. He died two years later, in his 80s. Hurok was the last of his kind; and Robinson does shed a lot more light than earlier quasi-autobiographies. A sometimes wobbly accounting but, overall, worthwhile. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The day Sol Hurok died he had lunched with Andres Segovia, met with Rudolf Nureyev and was on his way to see David Rockefeller when he collapsed of a heart attack. Hurok (1888-1974), who was born in an obscure Ukrainian village, traveled a long way to become probably the greatest impresario ever, a promoter of world-class ballet, performing companies, opera stars and musicians for some 50 years. Robinson's ( Sergei Prokofiev ) highly entertaining, fair-minded and closely researched biography is infinitely superior to the "authorized" studies of Hurok (even a movie) that were products of his publicity machine. For as Robinson shows, Hurok was as much a creation designed to dazzle the crowds as were the stars, who ranged from Pavlova and Chaliapin in the early years to Isaac Stern, Van Cliburn and the Moiseyev Dance Company later, all of whom he proudly offered under his "Sol Hurok Presents" rubric. Cunning, evasive, vain and often bullying, he had a star's temperament without the talent, and many thought he was a follower rather than a leader of popular artistic taste. He nevertheless was instrumental in building an American audience for ballet, promoted opera stars and concert musicians into celebrities and kept doors open between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. even in the darkest days of the Cold War. Robinson's book, aided by the impresario's only (much neglected) daughter, Ruth Hurok Lief, is full of good stories and is in itself a potted history of the arts in the U.S. during its subject's lifetime.

The lack of sleep, the shrinking social circle, the health difficulties all collide and force Henion to ask hard questions about our accepted wisdom on parenting and the lives of women.

Do you want to go?&#x201d; my guide David Barisa asked, breathlessly. David was in his thirties, but he had a certain youthful panache given his shaven head, gold-plated sunglasses, and street-savvy nubuck boots. I couldn&#x2019;t tell if his excitement was over the predator sighting or the excuse to speed.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been watching the largest wildebeest herd I&#x2019;d seen in the Serengeti, roughly 10,000 animals grazing and shuffling their feet in migration. Each year, some 1.3 million wildebeest move full circle through Kenya and Tanzania, following rains. They&#x2019;re joined by zebra and gazelle, as well as a cast of hungry characters that lurk in the fray. And the drama of all this&#x2014;as it&#x2019;s taught in textbooks&#x2014;was transpiring before me.</p><p>In the distance, thousands of additional wildebeest were clumped on the horizon, moving like silt-colored rivers. Breezes brought the sweet, nostalgic smell of hay. We bounded across rutted roads while David reeled off names of the animal groupings we&#x2019;d seen over the past few days: clan of hyena, pack of wild dogs, pride of lions, herd of elephants.</p><p>&#x201c;So, what do you call a group of cheetah?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re usually alone,&#x201d; David said, grinding a gear. &#x201c;But when I see them together, I just call them a family.&#x201d;</p><p>I had to ask because I&#x2019;m not a scientist. No, I&#x2019;m a part-time teacher and freelance writer, mother of a young child, wife of a carpenter. So what was I&#x2014;grader of papers, changer of diapers&#x2014;doing gallivanting around the Serengeti? Why had I left my husband and two-year-old son back home in the hills of southern Appalachia?</p><p>My answer might come across as insane, or&#x2014;at the very least&#x2014;overly dramatic.</p><p>But here&#x2019;s the truth: I was on an epic quest for wonder.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been chasing phenomena around the world for more than a year when I arrived in the Serengeti, and I still had many miles to go. But my inspiration had been sparked even before I became a mother, when&#x2014;three years before my son&#x2019;s birth&#x2014;I visited the overwintering site of the monarch butterfly in central Mexico. Before I accepted the magazine assignment that took me there, I&#x2019;d never even heard of the monarch migration, during which nearly the entire North American population comes to roost in a small swath of forest. But witnessing millions of butterflies swirling, dipping, and gliding over a single mountaintop gave me an actual glimpse of what I mean when I refer to myself as spiritual but not religious.</p><p>And&#x2014;in difficult times&#x2014;memories of that experience sustained me.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know that I suffered clinical postpartum depression when my son was born, but I began to empathize with the horror stories the condition can lead to. Inspired by butterflies, I had long ago dreamed up a list of other natural phenomena I&#x2019;d like to experience. But travel to far-flung lands? Once I had a baby, I considered myself lucky to make it to the grocery store before it was time for bed.</p><p>Still, I mused: Children have the capacity to marvel over simple things in nature&#x2014;leaves, twigs, pebbles. Couldn&#x2019;t exploring just a few of earth&#x2019;s most dazzling natural phenomena&#x2014;steeped as they are in science and mythology&#x2014;make the world similarly new again, reawakening that sort of wonder within me? Drudgery, after all, has nothing to do with growing up if we do it right and&#x2014;beyond tending to the acute physical needs of a child&#x2014;little to do with what it means to be a good parent.</p><p><i>Right?</i></p><p>Back then, I didn&#x2019;t know that acting out my self-designed pilgrimage would put me in the path of modern-day shamans, reindeer herders, and astrophysicists. I had no idea there were lay people from all over the world, from all walks of life, already going to great lengths to undertake the sorts of phenomena chases I&#x2019;d dreamed up. Some took odd jobs to stay under the northern lights. Others left white-collar positions to make time for swimming in glowing, bioluminescent bays. These were people who braved pirates to witness everlasting lightning storms, stood on volcanoes, stared into solar eclipses. They trusted their instincts, followed their passions, willfully shaped their days into the lives they most wanted to lead.</p><p>And, somewhere along the way, I became one of them.</p><p>David pulled into a line of safari vehicles. The cheetah family consisted of a momma and three cubs. We stood in the pop-up roof of our Land Cruiser to see into the heart of their grassy nest. After a few minutes, the mother decided to rise. Her babies followed, in single file, and she crossed the dirt road to approach a wildebeest herd.</p><p>When they were still a ways out, the cubs took a seated position. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s telling them to stay back,&#x201d; David said. The mother moved on. When she was just beyond the herd, she stopped to watch. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s teaching them how to stalk,&#x201d; David reported. &#x201c;How to survive. She&#x2019;s watching for a young wildebeest, the weakest of the herd.&#x201d;</p><p>The cubs were dark fuzz balls floating in a sea of grass. The mother cheetah stood taller. All her babies&#x2019; eyes were on her, watching. The light of day was beginning to fade. A giant elder wildebeest walked five feet in front of her. I gasped. Still, she waited.</p><p>&#x201c;He is too big for her,&#x201d; David said.</p><p>Finally, she found a baby wildebeest that had been pushed to the edge of the herd, and she slipped through grass like a fish slicing through a wave. The young wildebeest reacted, going from standing to swerving in seconds flat and, before I could even take a breath, a mother wildebeest appeared. She pushed the baby to the center of the herd, which erupted into honking that rippled across the savanna.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re warning each other,&#x201d; David said, like a foreign language interpreter. The cheetah was still, as if she&#x2019;d forgotten something. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t like to waste energy chasing something she doesn&#x2019;t think she can catch.&#x201d;</p><p>I quietly cheered for the young wildebeest. He was, after all, the main hero of the migratory story. <i>Wasn&#x2019;t he?</i> I watched the cheetah turn back toward her babies, who had traced her every move. Her head hung low. She appeared to be sulking. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going back to tell them they&#x2019;re going to bed hungry tonight,&#x201d; David said.</p><p>There were no clear winners. No easy answers. Only hard questions and survivors. But, because I had, for so long, only seen the pain of the wild on television, I had forgotten that there is also this: Long days of grazing through fields, listening to wind. Whole weeks spent sleeping in trees.</p><p>David, who had spent nearly every day of that year cruising the Serengeti, had seen only four predator kills in his lifetime. But he&#x2019;d logged thousands of hours of watching animals&#x2014;prey and predators alike&#x2014;relaxing. This is the sort of life human bodies were also built for&#x2014;acute stress and long periods of leisure, not the other way around.</p><p>A small group of wildebeest stopped to watch us pass. They were headed to the larger herd. Their life was a process, a cycle, a never-ending circle. But wasn&#x2019;t mine, too? All my life, I&#x2019;d thought: If I can just get into that college. If I can just make more money. If I can just birth this baby. If I can just get him through those scary first few months. If I can just make it through my first three weeks back at work. If I can just get my son potty trained. If I can just get a book contract. If I can just make it through the next eight nights sleeping alone in a canvas tent. <i>If I can just. If I can just. If I can just.</i></p><p>Staring into the field of hooves pounding the earth, it was clear I had been denying myself this: The seasonal migrations of my life, the initiations, would never end. There would always be a proving ground to face. But acknowledging and embracing this was crucial to moving forward. It seemed a path to reduced anxiety, and I could surely use that. Letting go of the abstract idea that at some point my life would be more complete than it was that very moment felt like letting go of some sort of underlying, constant fear I wasn&#x2019;t aware I had. Standing in the center of the Serengeti, it was apparent: I would benefit from balancing my abstract human thoughts with the visceral, phenomena-centered viewpoint of the animals that lived there.</p><p>Phenomenal is defined as that which is amazing. It also means that which is directly observable to the senses. And what began as a tour of extraordinary sights had evolved into the story of how&#x2014;in an abstract, digital world of overspecialization&#x2014;I was becoming the expert witness of my own life. When I returned home&#x2014;as I did for months at a time, in between one- and two-week phenomena chases&#x2014;I brought an expanded, global sense of wonder to bear on my own backyard, alongside my family.</p><p>&#x201c;They are going to cross,&#x201d; David said, nodding toward wildebeest that had lined the dirt road. Their pulse would quicken as they ventured out, but once they were back in the grass, it would slow. They&#x2019;d move on, in every sense of the phrase. David picked up speed, determined to reach camp before dark. I turned to watch the animals brave their crossing, but all I could see was a cloud of volcanic dust rising in our wake.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>METAMORPHOSIS</p><p>I AM FRANTICALLY SEARCHING FOR MY NEWBORN SON, ARCHER. I&#x2019;M ON my knees. My hands are slipping across cold hardwood floors. I grope my mattress&#x2019;s metal frame, the legs of his crib. I&#x2019;ve already thrown all the covers off my own bed, convinced he was suffocating in down.</p><p>When my panic reaches an apex, I wake up.</p><p>Sleepwalking. Night terrors. I have no idea what to call these episodes, but they have become a regular part of my life. More than once, at sunset, I have wept knowing I was assured another sleepless night to come. Sometimes, I cry into the night, watching my son nurse in his sleep as my husband, Matt&#x2014;a bookish woodworker with a collection of self-designed tattoos&#x2014;snores nearby.</p><p>Matt does not parent at night. That was established early on. Though I&#x2019;m already back at my day job&#x2014;teaching writing classes between nursing sessions&#x2014;he is working with power tools. Sleeplessness and power tools are not a good mix, and anyway, Archer wants milk. I am the supply. He is the demand. We are sharing my body. I am his ecosystem. He is mine. And it feels like we&#x2019;re clinging to each other for dear life. Matt is in our orbit, but he has become a distant planet.</p><p>When I am fully awake, I see Archer safely sleeping in his crib. I glance at the notebook where I record each of his nursing sessions so that I&#x2019;ll remember to rotate sides, lest my raw breasts began to bleed, again. He is nursing nine times every twenty-four hours, a system that means he is attached to my person, suckling, almost constantly.</p><p>I hear his every movement, each breath. I read too much about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. I cannot relax. I have not slept more than three straight hours since he was born, but I am especially shaken by the night&#x2019;s episode, which has actually brought me to my knees.</p><p>My mouth is dry. My hands press against hickory floors.</p><p>I rise to get a glass of water that my body will, in time, turn to milk like holy wine.</p><p>Dawn won&#x2019;t offer assurances. Days feel like hour-upon-hour of living underwater: the outside world muffled, every movement slowed to a languid speed. My friends tell me I seem to be handling things well. Things being the fact that my colicky son does none of the quiet, cooing lap sitting that seems so common in other people&#x2019;s babies.</p><p>I wonder if it&#x2019;s because I am afraid to tell the whole truth&#x2014;what happens beyond the hours I spend staring at my son in wonderment, amazed at the miracle of his life. I love and marvel over him as if he were my own heart pushed into the world and, still beating, set on top of my chest. Yet I cannot help but mourn the loss of something I can&#x2019;t quite place. I have an inner emptiness&#x2014;literal and figurative&#x2014;that I&#x2019;ve never felt before. It&#x2019;s as though nourishing his life has built a new chamber in my body that is now cavernous and empty, waiting to be filled.</p><p>I make my way into the living room without turning on any lights and walk toward a window, half expecting to catch sight of a bobcat. I see only the river below, a distant forest, and the hill leading to our garden plot. I feel like I am the only being awake in the world and&#x2014;despite the fact that I have just doubled the number of people I share a house with&#x2014;I have never felt more alone.</p><p>&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;</p><p>To his credit, Matt perpetually tries to bring friends back into our lives with more regularity, but his attempts&#x2014;often grand, as in &#x201c;Oh, did I mention I invited ten people over for dinner tomorrow&#x201d;&#x2014;don&#x2019;t always go over well. In fact, they often lead to arguments and, to my chagrin, me throwing fits and&#x2014;in my worst moments&#x2014;food. Are these out-of-control reactions the result of hormones, exhaustion, or are they proof I am becoming someone unrecognizable?</p><p>I hold Archer, literally, all day long. He will not lie in a crib without crying and I&#x2014;struggling with feelings of confusion, spousal resentment, and guilt over things I can&#x2019;t quite pinpoint&#x2014;cannot leave my baby when his face is wrenched. So, he sleeps on me. He plays on me. Constantly. Sometimes, especially around dinner, even this does not quell his crying episodes. I sing. I dance. I cry.</p><p>I have no hope of ever sleeping again. I have no hope.</p><p>I develop tendonitis in my arm. It hurts when I twist it to put him down, punishment I accept for thinking I might be able to go to the bathroom without a companion. I forget to brush my teeth. I don&#x2019;t shower. I can&#x2019;t figure out how to balance these simple things against my need to feel I&#x2019;m doing a good job&#x2014;the right things, what I&#x2019;m <i>supposed</i> to do.</p><p>When a friend tells me that her baby takes three-hour afternoon naps, about how she&#x2019;s concerned her child might be sleeping too much, I have a lurching physical reaction. I do Internet searches that lead me to terms like &#x201c;wakeful baby&#x201d; to explain why my experience is so very opposite. I find articles about wakeful babies being of higher intelligence, having a keen sense of curiosity. I want to believe them, but I suspect these articles were penned by parents like me as a form of solace in an excruciating time.</p><p>Finally, one day at around the six-month mark, I admit to myself that I am going to have a nervous breakdown if I don&#x2019;t take a shower each morning. I turn on a white-noise machine and put Archer in his crib. His tiny features crinkle like tissue paper being balled. His complexion turns crimson. I turn the water on and try to relax, impossible in my near-psychotic state. I hurriedly rinse my hair&#x2014;which has begun to fall out in clumps as my body attempts to readjust hormonally&#x2014;and I run back to him.</p><p>My friends, mothers, tell me that I will slowly get my life back. I don&#x2019;t believe them. My biggest fear&#x2014;my secret fear&#x2014;is the same one that plagued me years ago when I took a soul-killing receptionist job to quell my parents&#x2019; concerns about health care coverage: This is what my life is going to be from now on. Only, I no longer have the solace of a reception area full of <i>New Yorker</i> archives. It is impossible to read while nursing, because the rustling of pages wakes...</p></p><h2>Israel In Britain: A Brief Statement Of The Evidences In Proof Of The Israelitish Origin Of The British Race</h2><p>The following is a brief summary of the prophecies which have lead many people to believe that the British and the Anglo-Saxon race are the descendants of the Ten Tribes of Israel which were carried away captive in the years 743 and 721 B.C. Importance of the Subject. It has often been asked &#x2013; Of what value to the Christian, even if true, is the identity of the British with Israel? It has this importance, that whereas the apparent non-fulfilment of the promises to Israel is one of the strongest arguments of the infidel against the inspiration of the Bible, the evidence of their exact fulfilment in the British race has, in numerous cases, led unbelievers to believe in the truth of the Bible, and has thrown a new light on, and created a deep interest in, the predictions of the prophets which, previously, appeared to be of no significance or practical importance. This, of itself, ought to be of the greatest interest to every true Christian. May not indeed the recognition of this truth be one of the means for restoring the rapidly growing unbelief in the Bible which is undermining the moral character and rectitude of the nation and which is the certain forerunner of judgement? Secondly, the belief in their common origin and future fate could not fail to be a strong bond of union between the different portions of the nation, and this must be of the greatest importance in view of the attempts which are now being made to set class against class and to disintegrate the nation by separating certain portions from the remainder. (This would be the effect of giving Home Rule, as urged by some, to Scotland and Wales as if they were distinct peoples to the English.)</p><p></p><h2>The Profitable Artist: A Handbook for All Artists in the Performing, Literary, and Visual Arts</h2><p>While all art is unique, the challenges artists face are shared regardless of background, experience, and artistic medium.

Reprint.</p><p>J. Robert Lennon grew up in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. After completing his BA in English at the University of Pennsylvania he went on a creative writing course at the University of Montana. His first novel, The Light of Falling Stars stemmed from a recurring childhood dream about an air crash. It went on to win the 1997 Barnes and Noble Discover Great Writers Award. The Funnies, J. Robert Lennon&#39;s second novel, was published in 1999 and his third is On the Night Plain. J. Robert Lennon lives in Ithaca, New York State, with his wife and son. Granta Books will publish his collection of very short stories, Pieces for the Left Hand, in 2005.A debut novel in which many stories mingle in the wake of a plane crash. Marshall, Montana, is an agreeable college town. But its placidity is scarred by tragedy when AirAmerica flight 114 from Seattle plunges to the ground, apparently killing all but one passenger. Lennon uses the catastrophe as a means of linking otherwise disparate stories: those of families who have come to meet the plane, that of the lone survivor, Bernardo, and of the young couple, Paul and Anita Beveridge, who live near the crash site. The idea is promising, and the interest it garners credible, and yet the narrative lacks human and moral depth. As though trying a little too hard to include a cast varied in age, ethnicity, and experience, the author seems reluctant to choose a true emotional center. The closest he comes is in the Beveridges, whose strained marriage is indirectly pushed apart by the crash after Anita begins an affair with the uncle of a boy who died on board. But the Beveridges are relative newcomers to Marshall, and they don't really want to be there, having neither authenticity nor roots. Lennon might have done better to focus on Lars Cowgill, a midwesterner who found a home in Marshall and who's a more likable human gauge for the impact of disaster (his girlfriend Megan is among the dead). The best sections here are the glimpses of Marshall and its denizens: the ``Nouveau West'' knotty-pine decor at the small airport; the flyaway punk charm of Alyssa, a high- school student at loose ends who is briefly present in the novel; Lars's helplessly romantic slacker friend Toth, persuasively lost in post-adolescent muddle; and the streets, bowling alleys, and convenience stores of this quiet town. A sharp portrait of a place, but too often diluted by a scattered and uncertain plot and people. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They believe that a copy of any of these editions, marked up with the alterations they propose, will result in a text closer to what Joyce intended in 1922 than any that has yet been achieved. What is offered here, in fact, is not a new edition of Ulysses, but a kit for repairing the major faults of existing editions. <br><b>Contents:</b> Abbreviations and References; Introduction; Synopsis of JJA 12-27; Alterations to 1922; Alterations to 1961; Alterations to 1984^R</p><p></p><h2>Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds</h2><p>With biting irreverence for denominational prejudices and the pretensions of academics, Akenson renews our sense of awe before these religious works. He challenges received doctrines, arguing that the ancient Jews were indeed idol worshippers and that Saint Paul did not believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth or in the virgin birth. With wit, elegance, and clarity Surpassing Wonder makes the ancient Hebrew scriptures, the Christian New Testament, and the Talmuds of the Rabbis accessible to all and shows they can be understood only in relation to each other and against their specific historical settings. Akenson argues that each of the great texts must be considered as the product of a single author and thus as a religious invention ? that is, as a self-consciously formed unity rather than an anthology of disparate works. He also argues that the great inventor of the Hebrew scriptures should be credited with constructing the very concept of narrative history and thus the foundations of Western civilization. Using a rich and imagistic language that combines tractor mechanics, Winnie-the-Pooh, and architecture with analogies from astronomy, evolutionary biology, and economics, Akenson brings about nothing less than a radical reformation of how to think about the sacred texts. He restores their spiritual power through a just appreciation of the achievement of their authors while leaving readers to decide for themselves on the presence of a &#34;guiding hand.&#34; Surpassing Wonder is a penetrating study of the historian&#39;s craft and a brilliant exposï¿½ of how theologians and biblical scholars abuse historical reasoning and evidence in their treatment of the sacred texts. Just as a previous reformation cast out the priestly intercessors, so Akenson casts the scholars out of the temple and lets readers in to see the texts anew. In so doing he reinvests religion with meaning for a contemporary world and shows us how Western civilization was created not by the Greeks of Athens or the patricians of Rome but by the desert worshippers of Yahweh.</p><p>A book for readers of all faiths, <i>Surpassing Wonder</i> uncovers how the ancient Hebrew scriptures, the Christian New Testament, and the Talmuds of the Rabbis are related and how, collectively, they make up the core of Western consciousness.Donald Harman Akenson is Douglas Professor of Canadian and Colonial History at Queen&#39;s University.</p><h2>On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General&#39;s Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Personal account of the Israeli military response to the Egyptian attack launched across the Suez Canal in 1973, elaborating upon strategy, logistics, and the human intensity of involvement</p><p>Text: English, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>Rapture Becomes Her</h2><p>New York Times bestselling author Shirlee Busbee sweeps you into a breathtaking romance where a bold lady and a mysterious heir put their wits-and lives-to passion&#39;s ultimate test . . .

It also provides a good way of looking at the prose poem as a legitimate genre by focusing on what the poets themselves have to say about their own work.</p></p><p><p>"A Cast-Iron Aeroplane is at once a fun and valuable anthology because of its variety of prose poems and its format--80 poems by 80 poets, with commentaries on the poems by the poets. As the editor Peter Johnson suggests in his preface, it is refreshing to encounter poets unafraid of discussing their own work, and Johnson has set up non-restrictive terms for discussion worthy of the genre itself. As for the poems themselves, no succinct summary will do them justice. Generically speaking, they riff off the anecdote, the description, the short-short story, love poetry, surrealist poetry, and even ekphrastic poetry. Sometimes prose is mixed with verse, and one poem is reminiscent of a page out of a Renaissance emblem book. Playfulness is a leitmotif of the volume, but the play takes many forms, and it is often a prelude to a complex thought or an intense emotion that might not be accessible through direct approach or through verse in its traditional forms.</p><p>"The publication of this anthology is also an occasion to reflect on prose poetry as a genre, or an anti-genre, depending on where one is coming from. Here is where the combination of poems and commentaries is especially appealing/thought-provoking. The commentaries, in their rhetorical gestures, like digression and self-correction, often take on the qualities of the prose poems they are reflecting on, and this blurring between poem and commentary is one of the many winning features of the book, making this anthology a cast-iron airplane that actually does fly."</p><p>--Steven Monte, author of<em> Invisible Fences: Prose Poetry as a Genre in French and American Literature </em></p></p><h2>Vacationland: Tourism and Environment in the Colorado High Country (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)</h2><p>Winner of the Western Writers of America 2014 Spur Award for Best Western Nonfiction, Contemporary<br><br>Mention the Colorado high country today and vacation imagery springs immediately to mind: mountain scenery, camping, hiking, skiing, and world-renowned resorts like Aspen and Vail. But not so long ago, the high country was isolated and little visited. <i>Vacationland</i> tells the story of the region's dramatic transformation in the decades after World War II, when a loose coalition of tourist boosters fashioned alluring images of nature in the high country and a multitude of local, state, and federal actors built the infrastructure for high-volume tourism: ski mountains, stocked trout streams, motels, resort villages, and highway improvements that culminated in an entirely new corridor through the Rockies, Interstate 70.<br><br><i>Vacationland</i> is more than just the tale of one tourist region. It is a case study of how the consumerism of the postwar years rearranged landscapes and revolutionized American environmental attitudes. Postwar tourists pioneered new ways of relating to nature, forging surprisingly strong personal connections to their landscapes of leisure and in many cases reinventing their lifestyles and identities to make vacationland their permanent home. They sparked not just a population boom in popular tourist destinations like Colorado but also a new kind of environmental politics, as they demanded protection for the aesthetic and recreational qualities of place that promoters had sold them. Those demands energized the American environmental movement-but also gave it blind spots that still plague it today.<br><br>Peopled with colorful characters, richly evocative of the Rocky Mountain landscape, <i>Vacationland</i> forces us to consider how profoundly tourism changed Colorado and America and to grapple with both the potential and the problems of our familiar ways of relating to environment, nature, and place.</p><p><b>William Philpott </b>teaches history at the University of Denver."This history of the Colorado high country and the I-70 corridor will be indispensable in understanding how consumer culture and tourism shaped environmental politics and postwar landscapes. <i>Vacationland</i> is a smart analysis that's thoroughly researched and also fun to read."&#x2015;Annie Gilbert Coleman, author of Ski Style: Sport and Culture in the Rockies<p>"Written in a lively style and peopled by characters like balladeer John Denver and gonzo jounalist Hunter S.

He wrote about a possible heroine who was dying but in love with life. &#x201c;She is equally pathetic in her doom and in her horror of it. If she only could live just a little; just a little more &#x2013; just a little longer.&#x201d; In his outline James also had in his mind a young man who &#x201c;wishes he could make her taste of happiness, give her something that it breaks her heart to go without having known. That &#x201c;something&#x201d; can only be &#x2013; of course &#x2013; the chance to love and be loved.&#x201d; James also noted as a possibility the position of another woman to whom the man was &#x201c;otherwise attached and committed . . . It appears inevitably, or necessarily, preliminary that his encounter with the tragic girl shall be through the other woman.&#x201d; He also saw the reason why the young man and the woman to whom he was committed could not marry. &#x201c;They are obliged to wait . . . He has no income and she no fortune, or there is some insurmountable opposition on the part of her father. Her father, her family, have reasons for disliking the young man.&#x201d;<br> <br>This idea, then, of the dying young woman and the penniless young man on one side and, on the other, of father, family and young woman with no fortune circled in James&#x2019;s fertile mind. There was no moment, it seemed, in which the second young woman would have a mother; it was &#x201c;her father, her family&#x201d; that would oppose the marriage; over the next five or six years James would work out the form this opposition would take, and who exactly &#x201c;her family&#x201d; would be.<br> <br>In her book Novel Relations, Ruth Perry looked at the makeup of the family in the early years of the novel. &#x201c;Despite the emphasis,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;on marriage and motherhood in late eighteenth-century society, mothers in novels of the period are notoriously absent &#x2013; dead or otherwise missing. Just when motherhood was becoming central to the definition of femininity, when the modern conception of the all-nurturing, tender, soothing, ministering mother was being consolidated in English culture, she was being represented in fiction as a memory rather than as an active present reality.&#x201d;<br> <br>In nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century fiction, the family is often broken or disturbed or exposed, and the heroine is often alone, or strangely controlled and managed. If the heroine and the narrative itself are seeking completion in her marriage, then the journey there involves either the searching for figures outside the immediate family for support, or the breaking free from members of the family who seek to confine or dictate. In creating the new family upon marriage, the heroine needs to redefine her own family or usurp its power. In attempting to dramatize this, the novelist will use a series of tricks or systems almost naturally available to Jane Austen and the novelists who came after her; they could use shadowy or absent mothers and shining or manipulative aunts. The novel in English over the nineteenth century is filled with parents whose influence must be evaded or erased to be replaced by figures who operate either literally or figuratively as aunts, both kind and mean, both well-intentioned and duplicitous, both rescuing and destroying. The novel is a form ripe for orphans, or for those whose orphanhood will be all the more powerful for being figurative, or open to the suggestion, both sweet and sour, of surrogate parents.<br> <br>It is easy to attribute the absence of mothers in novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the large numbers of women who died in childbirth, as high as 10 per cent in the eighteenth century. The first wives of three of Jane Austen&#x2019;s brothers died in childbirth, for example, leaving motherless children. But this explanation is too easy. If it had suited novelists to fill their books with living mothers &#x2013; Jane Austen&#x2019;s mother outlived her, for example &#x2013; then they would have done so. In Novel Relations Ruth Perry takes the view that all the motherless heroines in the eighteenth-century novel &#x2013; and all the play with substitutions &#x2013; &#x201c;may derive from a new necessity in an age of intensifying individualism.&#x201d; This necessity involved separating from the mother, or destroying her, and replacing her with a mother-figure of choice. &#x201c;This mother,&#x201d; Perry writes, &#x201c;who is also a stranger may thus enable the heroine&#x2019;s independent moral existence.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thus mothers get in the way in fiction; they take up the space that is better filled by indecision, by hope, by the slow growth of a personality, and by something more interesting and important as the novel itself developed. This was the idea of solitude, the idea that a key scene in a novel occurs when the heroine is alone, with no one to protect her, no one to confide in, no one to advise her, and no possibility of this. Thus her thoughts move inward, offering a drama not between generations, or between opinions, but within a wounded, deceived or conflicted self. The novel traces the mind at work, the mind in silence. The presence of a mother would be a breach of the essential privacy of the emerging self, of the sense of singleness and integrity, of an uncertain moral consciousness, of a pure and floating individuality on which the novel comes to depend. The conspiracy in the novel is thus not between a mother and her daughter, but rather between the protagonist and the reader.<br> <br>Jane Austen&#x2019;s last three novels have motherless heroines. Austen, however, does not allow this to appear as loss, or does not let this expose the heroine, or take up much of her time. Rather it increases her sense of self, it allows her personality to appear more intensely in the narrative as though slowly filling space that had been quietly and slyly left for that purpose.<br> <br>In Pride and Prejudice there is a mother, but there are also two aunts, Elizabeth Bennet&#x2019;s Aunt Gardiner and Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s aunt Lady Catherine de Bourgh. It is an aspect of Austen&#x2019;s genius that, while the novel dissolves the power and influence of the mother, neutralizes her in ways both comic and blunt, the two aunts are painted in considerably different shades, one allowed a calm, civilizing subtlety, the other given a histrionic sense of entitlement. But none of the three older women in the book has any actual power, although two of them seek power and influence; power instead is handed directly to the heroine and this power arises from the quality of her own intelligence. It is her own ability to be alone, to move alone, to be seen alone, to come to conclusions alone, that sets her apart.<br> <br>When Jane Austen&#x2019;s niece herself became an aunt she wrote to her: &#x201c;Now that you have become an Aunt, you are a person of some consequence &amp; must excite great Interest whatever you do. I have always maintained the importance of aunts as much as possible, &amp; I am sure of your doing the same now.&#x201d; Austen was close to her own nieces and nephews, looked after some of them after their mothers died, and seemed to have been remembered fondly by all of them. She also lived in the hope of an inheritance from her mother&#x2019;s brother Mr. Leigh-Perrot, who was married and lived in Bath. The Leigh-Perrots were childless and not amusing, but they had to be kept sweet. Her uncle&#x2019;s will, which in 1817 left Austen and her siblings a thousand pounds only after their aunt&#x2019;s death, did not help Austen as she herself was ill and died soon afterwards.<br> <br>In Pride and Prejudice the two aunts also represent a changing England. Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s husband, who is Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s brother, lived from trade. He was, we are told, &#x201c;greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education&#x201d; and it is pointed out that the Netherfield ladies, Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s sisters, superior and snobbish and alert to class difference, &#x201c;would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.&#x201d; His wife &#x201c;was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her . . . nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.&#x201d; It is to her house in London that the sisters repair in that hushed interregnum in the book when both Bingley and Darcy have disappeared and with them the prospects for Jane. It is while travelling with her aunt and uncle that Elizabeth renews her relations with Darcy. It is via them that she discovers that Darcy has rescued her sister Lydia. In other words, the Gardiners in Pride and Prejudice offer stillness, unforced opportunity, vital information, none of which is available from their mother, or indeed their father. This idea that the sisters have to be removed from the family home for the novel to proceed makes the role of their uncle and aunt essential in the book, but also natural.<br> <br>Austen feels free, on the other hand, to make Lady Catherine de Bourgh imperious and comic, her wealth and power serving to make her ridiculous rather than impressive. She is an aunt who does not prevail; her presence in the book succeeds in making Darcy her nephew more individual, more himself and less part of any system. His aunt&#x2019;s function is not merely then to amuse us, or to show us an aspect of English manners that Jane Austen thought was foolish, but to allow her nephew, who refuses to obey her, a sort of freedom, a way of standing alone, that will make him worthy of Elizabeth and worthy too of the novel&#x2019;s moral shape. Its suggestion that only those who are prepared to move outside their family&#x2019;s arena of influence, to move out of the sphere of blood and inheritance as the centre of control, towards the autonomous and the personal, will become important in other areas of English life as the nineteenth century proceeds.<br> <br>Austen understood, however, the strange dynamic of an extended family and how much could be made fluid and uncertain, detached and semi-detached, within its boundaries. Within their family, both Jane Austen and her sister, Cassandra, as Marilyn Butler has pointed out in &#x201c;Jane Austen and the War of Ideas,&#x201d; &#x201c;played a key role as travellers between the households [of their brothers] and assiduous correspondents . . . Jane somewhat closer to and more preoccupied with two of her younger brothers &#x2013; Henry, said to have been her favourite, who lived in London, and the sailor Frank, who reported to her from various war fronts . . . The sisters made good aunts and friends to the next generation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since two of her brothers, Frank and Charles, went to sea and were away from home for long periods of time, it is easy to see the intensely tender and constant feelings that Fanny Price in Mansfield Park has for her brother William, also away at sea, as being a fundamental part of Austen&#x2019;s emotional world. The novel itself begins by breaking a family, by taking Fanny Price from her own impoverished family and handing her, almost as a changeling, to the care of her two aunts. The fact that she is penniless leaves her unprotected and requires her to be timid and passive.<br> <br>Since the opening of the novel has all the bearings of a fairy tale, it must have been tempting for Austen to make Lady Bertram, the aunt in whose house Fanny will live, an evil ogre and make Mrs. Norris, the aunt who lives nearby, into the kind and watchful aunt. Or make them both ogres. What she decided to do was to hand all the badness to Mrs. Norris. It is Mrs. Norris who emphasizes Fanny&#x2019;s precarious position as someone who is inside the family enough to be given shelter but outside it enough to be regularly insulted. When Fanny refuses to take part in the play-acting, for example, her aunt Norris emphasizes her isolation and vulnerability: &#x201c;I shall think her a very obstinate girl, if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her &#x2013; very ungrateful indeed, considering who and what she is.&#x201d;<br> <br>The reader is thus free to dislike Mrs. Norris for her cruelty and to admire Fanny for her forbearance. Austen&#x2019;s biographer Claire Tomalin sees Mrs. Norris as &#x201c;one of the great villains of literature&#x201d;; the critic Tony Tanner as &#x201c;one of Jane Austen&#x2019;s most impressive characters and indeed one of the most plausibly odious characters in fiction.&#x201d; All this is clear, at times rather too clear. What is not clear is what the reader should feel about the other aunt, Lady Bertram, the mistress of Mansfield Park. Tomalin dislikes her: &#x201c;Fanny&#x2019;s experience at Mansfield Park is bitter as no other childhood is in Austen&#x2019;s work. Her aunt, Lady Bertram, is virtually an imbecile; she may be a comic character and not ill-tempered, but the effects of her extreme placidity are not comic.&#x201d; Tanner takes a similar view:<br> <br>Lady Bertram is a travesty of those values [of quietness and repose]. She is utterly inert, unaware, and entirely incapable of volition, effort or independent judgement. She is of course an immensely amusing character; but she also reveals the Mansfield values run to seed. In effect, she never thinks, moves, or cares: amiable enough in that she is not malicious, she is, in her insentient indolence, useless as a guardian of Mansfield Park and positively culpable as a parent. And it is her sofa-bound inertia which permits the ascendancy of Mrs. Norris. Lady Bertram does not represent quietness and repose so much as indifference and collapse.<br> <br>In his essay on Mansfield Park, Lionel Trilling has another reading of Lady Bertram, claiming that she is a self-mocking representation of Jane Austen&#x2019;s wish to &#x201c;be rich and fat and smooth and dull . . . to sit on a cushion, to be a creature of habit and an object of ritual deference.&#x201d;<br> <br>It is possible to argue, on the other hand, that Lady Bertram, rather than being merely a piece of self-mockery, is one of Austen&#x2019;s most subtle, restrained and ingenious creations. This probably requires a different attitude to the novel than that displayed by Tomalin and Tanner, or indeed Trilling. The novel is not a moral fable or a tale from the Bible, or an exploration of the individual&#x2019;s role in society; it is not our job to like or dislike characters in fiction, or make judgements on their worth, or learn from them how to live. We can do that with real people and, if we like, figures from history. They are for moralists to feast on. A novel is a pattern and it is our job to relish and see clearly its textures and its tones, to notice how the textures were woven and the tones put into place. This is not to insist that a character in fiction is merely a verbal construct and bears no relation to the known world. It is rather to suggest that the role of a character in a novel must be judged not as we would judge a person. Instead, we must look for density, for weight and strength within the pattern, for ways in which figures in novels have more than one easy characteristic, one simple affect. A novel is a set of strategies, closer to something in mathematics or quantum physics than something in ethics or sociology. It is a release of certain energies and a dramatization of how these energies might be controlled, given shape.<br> <br>Lady Bertram in Mansfield Park in this context is easy to read; her role in the pattern of the book is obvious. She is not good, she performs no good or kind act that matters; nor is she bad, since, in turn, she performs no bad act that matters. But she is there in the book, in the house, in the family. Fanny has already lost one mother, who effectively has given her a...</p><h2>Hugh Nibley: A Consecrated Life</h2><p>As one of the LDS Church&#39;s most widely recognized scholars, Hugh Nibley is both an icon and an enigma.

Cremation on Thursday, 28th December, 2.30 p.m. at Hoop Lane, Golders Green Crematorium, West Chapel. No flowers please. Donations, if desired, to North London Hospice.<br> <br>Daily Telegraph, December 28, 2006<br> <br>Hanns Alexander&#x2019;s funeral was held on a cold and rainy afternoon three days after Christmas. Considering the weather, and the timing, the turnout was impressive. More than three hundred people packed into the chapel. The congregation arrived early, and in full force, grabbing all the seats. Fifteen people from Hanns&#x2019;s old bank, Warburg&#x2019;s, were in attendance, including the former and current CEO. His close friends were there, as was the extended family. Hanns&#x2019;s wife of sixty years, Ann, sat in the front row, along with the couple&#x2019;s two daughters, Jackie and Annette.<br> <br>The synagogue&#x2019;s cantor recited the Kaddish, the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead. He then paused. Looking down upon Ann and her two daughters, he delivered a short sermon, saying how sorry he was for their loss and how Hanns would be missed by the entire community. When he had finished, two of Hanns&#x2019;s nephews stood to give a joint eulogy.<br> <br>Much was familiar: Hanns growing up in Berlin. The Alexanders fleeing the Nazis and moving to England. Hanns fighting with the British Army. His career as a low-level banker. His commitment to the family and his half-century of schlepping for the synagogue.<br> <br>But there was one detail that caught nearly everyone off guard: that at the war&#x2019;s end Hanns had tracked down the Kommandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Hï¿½ss.<br> <br>This piqued my interest. For Hanns Alexander was my grandmother&#x2019;s brother, my great-uncle. Growing up, we had been cautioned not to ask questions about the war. Now I learned that Hanns may have been a Nazi hunter.<br> <br>The idea that this nice but unremarkable man had been a Second World War hero seemed unlikely. Presumably, this was just another of Hanns&#x2019;s tales. For he was a bit of a rogue and a prankster, much respected for sure, but also a man who liked to play tricks on his elders and tell dirty jokes to us youngsters, and who, if truth be told, was prone to exaggeration. After all, if he had really been a Nazi hunter, wouldn&#x2019;t it have been mentioned in his obituary?<br> <br>I decided to find out if it was true.<br> <br>*<br> <br>We live in an age when the waters are closing over the history of the Second World War, when we are about to lose the last remaining witnesses, when all that is left are accounts retold so many times that they have lost their original veracity. And so we are left with caricatures: Hitler and Himmler as monsters, Churchill and Roosevelt as conquering warriors, and millions of Jews as victims.<br> <br>Yet Hanns Alexander and Rudolf Hï¿½ss were men with many sides to their characters. As such, this story challenges the traditional portrayal of the hero and the villain. Both men were adored by their families and respected by their colleagues. Both grew up in Germany in the early decades of the twentieth century and, in their way, loved their country. At times, Rudolf Hï¿½ss, the brutal Kommandant, displayed a capacity for compassion. And the behavior of his pursuer, Hanns Alexander, was not always above suspicion. This book is therefore a reminder of a more complex world, told through the lives of two men who grew up in parallel and yet opposing German cultures.<br> <br>It is also an attempt to follow the courses of the two men&#x2019;s lives, and to understand how they came to meet. And the attempt raises difficult questions. How does a man become a mass murderer? Why does a person choose to confront his persecutors? What happens to the families of such men? Is revenge ever justified?<br> <br>Even more, this story is an argument that when the worlds of these two men collided, modern history was changed. The testimony that emerged proved particularly significant in the war crimes trials at the end of the Second World War: Hï¿½ss was the first senior Nazi to admit to executing Himmler and Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution. And he did so in great and shocking detail. This testimony, unprecedented in its description of human evil, drove the world to swear that such unspeakable atrocities would never again be repeated. From this point forward, those suffering from extreme injustice could dare to hope for intervention.<br> <br>It is also the story of surprise. In my comfortable north London upbringing, Jews&#x2014;and I am one&#x2014;were cast as the victims of the Holocaust, not its avengers. I had never really questioned that stereo-type until I fell into this story. Or, to be more accurate, it fell to me.<br> <br>This is a Jew-fighting-back story. And while there are some well-known examples of resistance&#x2014;uprisings in the ghettos, revolts in the camps, attacks from the woods&#x2014;such examples are few. Each should be celebrated, as an inspiration to others. Even when faced with profound brutality, hope for survival&#x2014;and perhaps revenge&#x2014;is still possible.<br> <br>This is a story pieced together from histories, biographies, archives, family letters, old tape recordings and interviews with survivors. And it is a story that was, for reasons that I think will become clear, never fully told by the men at its heart: Hanns and Rudolf.</p><h2>Daily Guideposts 365 Spirit-Lifting Devotions for Women</h2><p><b>About the series: Spirit-Lifting Devotions are compiled by the editors of the annual Daily Guideposts, which since 1977 has helped millions of readers to grow in faith and live fuller, richer lives through prayerfully sharing in the personal experiences of its writers.</b> <p> This life-changing book is a collection of real-life devotions by today's best-loved inspirational writers. <i>Daily Guideposts</i> favorites such as Debbie Macomber, Sue Monk Kidd, Marion Bond West, and Sharon Elwell Foster share their experiences and end with a personal prayer for the day.

Who was Beatrice, really? Was De Vulgari Eloquentia truly a treatise on the art of writing? Did he need a medicinal muse? Dante scholar and translator Barbara Reynolds contends the master used cannabis to soar to greater creative heights.<br>Besides proposing a solution to the famous prophecies, this lively, engaging, and elegantly written biography contains a provocative new idea in virtually every chapter, offering alternative interpretations of his work. Drawing from an impressive array of sources, Reynolds provides a comprehensive analysis of the poet, placing him within the context of his culture and society to deepen our understanding of a complicated man who was irritable, opinionated, and vengeful&#x2014;and an extraordinary genius.</p><p>Barbara Reynolds is one of the world&#39;s best known Dante scholars. She completed the Penguin translation of Paradiso after the death of Dorothy L Sayers. She also translated Dante&#39;s early work La Vita Nuova and Ariosto&#39;s Orlando Furioso. In addition, she has written a biography of Dorothy L Sayers and edited The Cambridge Italian Dictionary.*Starred Review* Dante achieved some of his loftiest poetic flights by using cannabis? Acclaimed translator and scholar Barbara Reynolds thinks it quite possible, and adduces textual evidence from the <i>Commedia </i>to support her provocative view. To be sure, Reynolds' new biography of the Florentine poet offers much more than controversy over psychedelic substances. Limning a unifying theme in Dante's masterpiece, Reynolds illuminates the poet's conviction that right governance would come to Europe only when all recognized the Holy Roman emperor--and not the pope--as the supreme political authority. Impressive close readings of pivotal passages reveal how deeply Dante yearned for the triumph of the ideal secular monarch and how bitterly disappointed he was by the papal intrigues that denied Emperor Henry VII such a triumph. But Reynolds also shows how Dante found both solace and financial security in the poetic art he turned to after a failed venture in philosophical writing. The <i>Commedia </i>reflects far more than its creator's financial circumstances, however. In Dante's intense love for Beatrice, Reynolds discerns an intellectual passion that transforms an otherwise obscure young Florentine lady into a complex figure capable of descending to crude invective and of rising to heavenly truth. Serious readers of Dante will find much here to ponder--and debate. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

"Hair for hands to touch and play! Hair to take the gloom away." This rhythmic read-aloud is, on the surface, all about hair: nappy, plaited, long, short, natural, twisted, "soft like cotton, flower petal billowy soft, full of frizz and fuzz." Comb through the surface and find a celebration of childhood and girls and the freedom to express individuality. The rituals implied in the book are rooted in the traditions of hooks's own childhood, when "doing" hair was just as much an excuse for girls to laugh and tell stories and just be together. Going still deeper is the much-needed message encouraging girls to love and accept themselves (and others) just the way they are.<p> In bell hooks's first venture into children's books, she wisely teams up with Caldecott Honor-winning illustrator Chris Raschka (<i>Yo! Yes?</i>, <i>Mysterious Thelonious</i>). Raschka's bold paint strokes on a color wash background are strikingly original--a perfect match for the exuberant text. This beautiful picture book will surely make any reader, young or old, happy to be nappy--and anyone who raved or ranted over Carolivia Herron and illustrator Joe Cepeda's <i>Nappy Hair</i> will welcome this joyful, celebratory book.

Abraham and Moses have experiences of God; the writers of Genesis and Exodus relate the experiences. The prophets experience God; their prophecies find words to express that experience. We read the prophets to learn what God told them. But we also read, hoping, through them, to have a vicarious experience of God.&#x2014;From the Introduction <br><br> Christianity is a mysterious faith. Some of these mysteries can be described with Scripture or doctrine, but others can only be experienced. Those graced with these experiences, these intimate glimpses of God, are called mystics. <br><br> Father Bodo's sensitive guidance leads us into the heart of what these mystics have expressed about God and how their insight can deepen our own experience of the divine. <br><br> With guides ranging from Mary, the mother of Jesus, to Francis of Assisi, to Gerard Manley Hopkins, centuries of mystical insights invite us to experience for ourselves the boundless mystery of God. <br><br> Includes:<br> Mary<br> St. Francis of Assisi <br> Jacopone Da Todi <br> Julian of Norwich <br> St. Catherine of Siena <br> St. John of the Cross <br> St. Terese of Lisieux <br> Gerard Manley Hopkins <br> Simone Weil <br> Robert Lax<br></p><p>MURRAY BODO, O.F.M., is a Franciscan priest and member of the Franciscan Academy.

The disgusted thief tosses Punch from a skyscraper window, setting him free to pursue his knavery throughout the city: he whacks a man who squeezes into his bus-stop seat, then allies himself with muggers and helps them hijack a limousine by causing a diversion (he sprays a ``naughty word''--''Stupid''--on it). Charmed by Punch's driving (over the rooftops), the oblivious owner, ``Mr. Helmstrump,'' hires him as a chauffeur--a post that Punch fills until he happens on the other puppets, performing in Central Park. Provensen's airy, carefully structured illustrations are a loving tribute to the city (whose reputation sometimes seems almost as notorious as the classic bad-guy puppet's); her irrepressible Punch goes through his paces with appropriately wicked glee. It's an inspired pairing, resulting in an unusual, highly entertaining book with many intriguing details to explore. A sensible ``Note on Punch'' explains that he ``doesn't motivate us to do evil deeds [but] provides us with a harmless outlet for our guilty thoughts.'' (Picture book. 4+) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In Provensen's talented hands, the unlovable Punch is skillfully resurrected for a generation perhaps unfamiliar with his dastardly deeds. Brought to New York City in the suitcase of Il Professore Tucci-Piccini, Punch is immediately stolen by a thief hoping to snatch a valise full of money. The worthless bag is soon discarded, and Mr. Punch finds himself alone on the streets of the Big Apple. True to form, the conniving marionette outsmarts policemen, muggers and a chauffeur to land himself a job with "the Richest Man in the World" before reuniting with Judy, the Baby, the Hangman and the others. The jaunty text brims with mischief and Provensen's distinctively detailed illustrations are rendered in the bright, buoyant colors of puppetry. Her Manhattan is a suitably kinetic metropolis of limos, hot dog stands and countless skyscrapers, many of which bear the au courant designation Helmstrump. Happily, Provensen's Punch is not nearly as nasty as the character she describes in her "Note on Punch" at the end; here, he seems no more harmful than a cartoon villain.

She knew from the age of four that she would grow up to be an illustrator. Born in Philadelphia, she lived most of her life in Lyme, New Hampshire.Kindergarten-Grade 5-In this altered version of the well-known tale, Kimmel has combined elements of the original plot and the Cinderella story. He has omitted the introduction to the tale, which describes the wild man's capture, and begins the story as the young prince (named Walter) frees his father's prized possession and then, fearing his wrath, runs away with Iron John, who raises him. When Walter is grown, he is sent out into the world and volunteers to serve a king. After winning the hearts of the three princesses at a masked ball and beating all challenges at the king's tournament, the young man is wounded while slaying a band of robber knights who have carried off the princesses. Only the tears of his beloved (here a garden maid named Elsa) save him. He is never reunited with his parents, but returns to Iron John's kingdom. Hyman has illustrated the tale in full-and one-third page, muted oil paintings peopled with characters whose lovely faces are familiar echoes of many of her earlier folktale illustrations. Her forest is dark and eerie by night, a fern-filled grotto by day; her palace garden a charming composite of color; her wild man appropriately wizened and hoary. Alas, the captivating romanticism of the pictures cannot compensate for the lack of cohesiveness and requisite fairy-tale elements. In contrast, each part of the original Grimm tale contributes something to the whole. Iron Hans, illustrated by Marilee Heyer (Viking, 1993) is an authentic version of the story, dramatically illustrated.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of the Hawaiian Kingdom: A Pictorial History</h2><p>A concise, pictorial history of Hawaii and its rulers from the birth of Kamehameha the Great to the establishment of the Territory of Hawaii in 1900.

This would be the first time on our own -- without responsibilities and free to go anywhere and try anything. </p> <p>On previous trips we had seen all the famous monuments and "tourist sights." The guidebooks claimed that locals were rude and indifferent to visitors but there had to be more to the people of Paris than that. This time we wanted to find the real Parisians. </p> <p>We spent some time exploring small shops and lesser-known museums and churches. We walked along canals and down narrow lanes, seeing a different Paris, but still not making any real contact with the people of this magnificent city. </p> <p>One evening, with the help of the night clerk at our quaint hotel, we found a tiny cafe known only to locals. Nestled inside a dark passage, its unlit sign read, "Chez Maurice." We peeked in the small window on the door to see a small room with half a dozen tables, each with enough chairs for eight patrons. We opened the heavy door and went inside. </p> <p>We were greeted by a burly proprietor, whose smile faded when he discovered we were foreigners with a limited command of the French language. He turned his back and retreated to the kitchen, muttering under his breath and slowly shaking his head from side to side. Not a good start. </p> <p>A moment passed and a young woman led us to our seats at the other end of a table already occupied by an elderly couple. She gave us two menus. </p> <p>For a few minutes we struggled to recall a few French words, but discovered that the descriptions of each dish were too much for us. </p> <p>Our table mates noticed our dilemma. The old man leaned over and began explaining each dish, one at a time. Since he spoke very little English, his translations took the form of elaborate gestures and animal sounds. A fish entree was depicted as a fish swimming upstream, jumping and splashing in the water. For the beef dish, he pretended that his hands were horns on the side of his head, accompanied by a 'mooing' sound. </p> <p>When the young waitress returned, we placed our order and our new 'friends' gave her explicit instructions on how to prepare the food and what side dishes we should have. Despite our limited ability to speak the other's language, we continued our lively conversation throughout the meal. We discovered that they were in their seventies and had been sweethearts for about ten years. She lived nearby in Paris, while he lived in the country. They met here once a week to share a pleasant dinner. Frankly, I have no idea how we understood each other, but we talked about the beauty of Paris, our lives and families, and of course, our other travels.</p> <p> Near the end of the evening, a flower vendor made her way through the cafe. We watched as the old gentleman purchased a bouquet. Artfully, he plucked two flowers from the bunch, presented the bouquet to his lady, and gave her a kiss. Then, bowing smartly in our direction, he held out a rose, one for each of us.</p> <p> We had found our Paris.</p> <p><i>&#x2014;Betty Corbin</i></p> <p>ï¿½2002. All rights reserved.

The ticket had begun as a blue-ordinary, but soon encountered a small but useful device of Imbry's own manufacture, which bedecked it in an electronic mirage that fooled the shuttle's automatic scanners. At ease in the red-tab compartment's sumptuous lounge, the fraudster helped himself to a smattering of delicacies from the circulating buffet and accepted a glass of quite decent golden Phalum.At Sherit's main terminus, Imbry's appearance excited no comment. His only outstanding feature was a pronounced corpulence but even this he used to his advantage, contriving his features into an arrangement that conveyed benign geniality, the image of the jolly fat fellow. His garb was also commonplace in Sherit that year: a voluminous jacket of dark patent leather over flared pantaloons patterned in contrasting stripes of red and white, with shoes that matched the leather and a hat that echoed the cloth.He recovered his carryall bag from the here-you-are, then wove his way through the crowds of travelers to the ring road outside. There he spied a passing omnibus that bore the name of the Trabboline Inn. The slow-moving conveyance was trolling for in-bound travelers who had not yet reservedlodgings, its illuminated sides displaying the Trabboline's rates and attractions.Luff Imbry assembled his face into a pleasing distribution of smiles and winks, then stepped aboard and spoke affably to the vehicle's operator, a stubby person with pale hair and eyes whose gender remained indeterminate under the baggy one-piece work garb typical of lower-class Sheritics. The response was brusque, somewhat more than a grunt although not quite an actual syllable, but Imbry was not so easily put off."I believe the Trabboline offers discrete classes of accommodation," he said, "from Green Basic to Platinum Superior?"The inquiry drew a confirmatory sound from deep in the Sheritic's throat."And Platinum Superior is available only to persons of the renunciant class?"This time the answer was more growl than grunt. Imbry had uncovered a raw patch on the driver's psyche. He proceeded to abrade it. "I am impressed by the renunciant concept," he said. "The wide world marvels at the wisdom of Sheritics in having created such a beneficial institution."At this, the Sheritic voiced a short word that expressed an uncomplimentary assessment of Imbry's views, then reached up and pulled down a folding divider that insulated the operator's compartment from passengers. The vehicle jerked as it picked up speed.Luff Imbry settled back in his seat and regarded the passing scenery with happy anticipation. The driver's smoldering anger had ignited at the mere mention of Sherit's highest social class. Tensions were clearly rising. Conflict and dislocation were in the offing, a situation from which Imbry expected to profit substantially.He alighted in the portico of the Trabboline, a sprawlingseven-story complex of yellow stone and white stucco. The lobby was spacious and quiet, the staff alert and attentive to their guests' needs. Imbry asked for the kind of room favored by commerciants traveling on moderate expense allowance, offering a credit authorization that he had abstracted from its rightful owner and adapted to his own ends. The clerk returned it to him with a discreet flourish, calling Imbry by the name that happened to be impressed on the chit--Florion Tobescu--and adding the general Sherit honorific, "Recipient.""I am curious as to your renunciants," he told the clerk. "Where might I expect to see some of them?"The Sheritic raised his nose to a considerable height. His eyes now seemed to regard Imbry from the far side of an unbridgeable gap. "I regret, Rp. Tobescu, that casual sightseeing is felt to be an imposition," he said."Just so," said Imbry. "Still, if one were inclined to cast an unobtrusive glance in the direction of a renunciant, which direction would you recommend?"The clerk looked away, but one hand fluttered toward an archway on the far side of the lobby. The entrance was blocked by a braided rope of gold slung between two stanchions, and attended by a brisk-looking man wearing a uniform that identified him as either a military officer of overwhelming rank or a menial employed to admit or deny passage beyond the barrier. Idly perambulating through the lobby, Imbry placed himself so as to glance through the archway. It led to a short corridor that soon curved out of sight. He noticed distinct differences in the quality of decor on either side of the braided rope. The carpet beyond was of a deeper pile, its color richer than that which covered the lobby floor. The walls were clad in a fabric that shimmered delicately through several muted shades of pink and gray.A warm scent hung in the air, unrecognizable yet tantalizing.Imbry approached the corridor's guardian. "May I enter?" he said.The doorman looked him up and down in less time than it would take to describe the inspection. "No, recipient. This part of the hotel is for renunciants only.""Yet I am intrigued," said Imbry. "I must know what lies beyond.""First acquire a fortune and shed it to the benefit of the Divestment," said the guardian. "I shall then be glad to admit you.""I might do as you suggest," said Imbry, "but how do I know if the reward is worth the effort? Let me sample the delights reserved for renunciants and I will surely be motivated to better myself."The man stiffened and said, "You are an outlander and perhaps not aware that your proposition borders on the offensive. Please entertain yourself elsewhere."Imbry leaned closer and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial murmur. "I don't suppose a quiet contribution could persuade you to look in another direction while I accidentally wander into this hallway?"The doorman's eyes grew large and a deeper color welled from his neck into his face. "You are now across the border of offensiveness and flush with the gates of criminality. Leave immediately, recipient, or I will summon the provost. Confined to the Contemplarium, you will experience a standard of accommodation much at variance with what you see here."Imbry converted his face into an image of apology, made placatory gestures with his plump hands, and eased away. Clearly, not every Sherit menial was ready to turn on the renunciants, but this loyal guardian's quickness to take offense still echoed an underlying carrier wave of social tension.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Seated in an overstuffed chair on the other side of the Trabboline's lobby, a slim young man named Baro Harkless watched Luff Imbry's encounter with the doorman from the corner of one eye while feigning interest in a periodical. Had he wanted to, he could have surreptitiously eavesdropped on the conversation, could have recorded it in both image and sound, could even have measured the autonomic responses of both men. The equipment for such surveillance was secreted about his person, but Baro was operating on the assumption that Imbry was cunning enough to take habitual measures to determine if he was under observation. Consequently, the agent restricted himself to level-two passive observation, as specified in the surveillance handbook of the Archonate Bureau of Scrutiny, which he had memorized entirely, along with every other manual and standing order that governed Bureau operations.When Imbry had recrossed the lobby and stepped into an ascender tube, Baro went to the desk. "I believe I just saw an acquaintance take the ascender," he told the clerk, "though his name temporarily escapes me."The clerk gave him a look that indicated no wish to learn more about Baro Harkless's acquaintances, past, present, or future. "The recipient is a guest of the hotel. His privacy may not be trod upon."Baro looked about to ensure that no one was within hearing, then produced a card that identified him as a Bureau agent, though he covered the part of the card that defined his status as still probationary. "Perhaps we might tread just a little."Archonate authority could not be gainsaid. "He is Rp. Florion Tobescu, a traveling commerciant.""And what room?""West eighteen on the seventh floor.""What does the window of that room look out upon?" Baro asked, and learned that Imbry had a view of the hotel's inner courtyard, which contained a formal garden and an outdoor refectory."Thank you," he said. "Now I would like a room across the courtyard, with a window that looks in on his."The clerk worked the keys of an instrument set below the level of the counter, then indicated where the young man should press his palm to a sensor. "And the account?" he asked."To the attention of Directing Agent Ardmander Arboghast, Bureau headquarters in Olkney," Baro said. "And of course you will say nothing to the person we have been discussing."The clerk sniffed. "Of course."Established in a room directly opposite Imbry's, Baro resumed level-two surveillance: that is, he sat in a shadowed part of his room and stared through the two intervening thicknesses of glass and the expanse of air that separated them. The target of his steadfast gaze had reposed himself upon the bed, with his hands clasped behind his head. He appeared to have fallen asleep.Baro watched the even rise and fall of Imbry's rounded abdomen and thought, not for the first time, about contacting Directing Agent Arboghast. He knew that he was technically breaching procedure, and that by following the quarry from Olkney to Sherit he had overstepped the terms of his assignment.His section chief had ordered him only to shadow the swindler about the city for the day, then compose a written report. It had been a training exercise, the target chosen from a Bureau list of career felons who were not regarded as dangerous and who were not targets of active investigations. Baro Harkless had been sent on the training drill because, althoughhe had graduated with high marks from the Academy, he had not completed his field training.There were rumors about Arboghast, that he had been transferred to the training command from the investigations branch after a major case came apart in his hands. There were hints of other faults besides. Baro paid no heed to gossip, but he did know that Arboghast was a man of strong opinions. The weight of those opinions, when they were landing on probationary agents, was equivalent to that of a moderate-sized boulder.Baro had begun the day loitering near Imbry's lodgings in the fashionable Quabbs district of Olkney City. When his target came down to the street, he had followed the man, at the prescribed distance and using available opportunities for concealment, to a local bistro where Imbry breakfasted on cakes and punge. The fraudster had then gone home, but reemerged almost immediately with carryall in one hand, the other raised to hail a passing jitney. Fortunately, another vehicle for hire was passing, and Baro managed to get into it before Imbry was out of sight.Their destination turned out to be Olkney's main airdrome, where the trickster had apparently booked passage on the Sherit shuttle. By the time Baro reached the wicket and obtained a ticket, the airship had already begun running up its gravity obviators in preparation for departure. There was no time to contact his superior. The young man threw himself along the connecting tube into the blue-ordinary compartment just as the crew was closing the aircraft's door.En route to his seat, he looked about for Imbry, and felt something cold climb his spine as he realized that his quarry was not in any of the blue-tab seats. Had the swindler spotted him for a clumsy neophyte and decided it would be a good joke to gull the greenhorn into a long and pointless trip out oftown? A droplet of chill sweat ran between Baro's shoulder blades as he imagined the ensuing conversation with Arboghast. It would involve a great deal of standing at quivering attention on his part, while the section chief indulged his well-known proclivity for inventive profanity and unflattering rhetorical questions.He rose, and was about to ask the cabin attendant to halt the aircraft's departure. But the crewman was busy pulling closed the curtain that separated red-tab travelers from blue-ordinaries. Behind the cloth, first-class passengers lolled, freed of any uncomfortable awareness that, nearby, fellow human beings were crammed into seats designed to suit only the abnormally short and underweight. Beneath the attendant's raised arm, as the curtain was drawn, Baro caught a brief glimpse of his quarry hoisting a goblet of golden wine in first class.The sweat evaporated from Baro's brow and he sank back into the undersized seating. He comforted himself: whatever else Imbry was up to, he could now be charged with fraudulent conversion of a travel authority. As well, although it was not an offense to have unknowingly frightened an agent of the Bureau, Baro meant for Imbry to learn that it was nonetheless a bad idea.Now, as the probationary agent sat in his hotel room and watched Imbry sleep, his mind again reluctantly turned to Ardmander Arboghast. The lull in activity afforded him ample opportunity to make contact with his section chief, yet Baro did not do so. His thinking was leading him in other directions.He had definitely overstepped when he had followed Imbry out of Olkney, and there was no guarantee that Arboghast would accept his protestations of being too hurried to make contact. He sensed that there was a mutual lack of empathy between his commander and himself. His explanations, no matter how cogent, might therefore meet with automatic dismissal.He could find himself branded unsuitable for field assignments. Instead, as his Academy tutor, Bost Hamel, had recommended, he might be consigned to the desert of the Bureau's research branch, to spend his career coaxing correlations and coincidences out of endless data banks.The prospect of forty years in the research office was not what had drawn Baro into the Bureau. It had been a desire to follow in the footsteps of his father, Captain-Investigator Baro Harkless, who had blazed a brilliant career in the investigations branch--or at least the first half of a brilliant career.His father had died in the crash of an aircar while bringing Cham Fretilin, the selective cannibal, to face justice. The aircar's controls had failed over a populated area. Unable to prevent its fall, Captain Harkless had wrestled with the steering yoke, managing to guide the aircraft into the sea.Now, watching Luff Imbry, Baro knew that if he were to make contact with Directing Agent Arboghast when he could report nothing but the presence of a somnolent criminal on a hotel bed, his career within the Bureau might be diverted into unwelcome channels. On the other hand, if Luff Imbry were to lead him to an actual offense in progress--and he had no doubt that crime was the trickster's aim--then Baro could swoop like an unsuspected nemesis at the appropriate cusp and affect an arrest.That would give him undiluted credit for scotching Imbry's scheme, an accomplishment sure to outweigh any quibbles over whether or not he had reported in quite as often as was stipulated in the manual on surveillance.He allowed himself a few moments to savor images of Imbry's apprehension, then replayed it with variou...</p><h2>Ultimate High: My Everest Odyssey</h2><p>A personal account of one man&#39;s determination to climb Mount Everest alone describes how the Swedish climber accomplished his goal, within days of the 1995 tragedy that took the lives of a number of fellow climbers</p><p>Why just climb Everest when you can climb it without supplemental oxygen? Why just climb it without oxygen when you can climb it alone? And why fly to Nepal to climb Everest when you can bicycle all the way there? Apparently, questions such as these occurred to Gï¿½ran Kropp, a Swede with a taste for adventure and a desire for the <i>Ultimate High</i>. In October 1995, Kropp set out from Sweden with a bicycle, a trailer, and over 200 pounds of equipment. Over the next four months, he cycled some 7,000 miles across Eastern Europe, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. By the time he arrived in Kathmandu, Kropp had been shot at, pelted with rocks, and offered the madam's daughter--free of charge--in a Hungarian brothel. <p> After carrying his own equipment up to Everest Base Camp, Kropp found himself surrounded by other climbers, all waiting for a break in the weather so they could attempt the summit. Many books have been written about that disastrous season on Everest, notably Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i> and Anatoli Boukreev's <i>The Climb</i>. Kroop adds little of substance to the story, engaging mainly in camp gossip about who was sleeping with whom and "outing" climbers who lied about reaching summits. Even Kropp's account of his own climb is somewhat suspenseless--though some readers will be relieved that he doesn't go into too much detail about his physical breakdown. More tiresome is Kropp's clear disdain for climbers who use supplemental oxygen. ("Mount Everest is not 29,028 feet tall if the mountain is scaled by a climber wearing an oxygen mask.") He also despises climbers who "see Everest and other high peaks reduced to trophies kept in a china cabinet"--though his "Ultimate Mountain List" (he's already climbed 16 of the 22) seems a bit like a trophy room itself.</p><p> After he finally reached the summit--on his third attempt in under a month--Kropp spent a few weeks recuperating in Kathmandu and then hopped on his bike for the long and rugged ride home. Not satisfied, Kropp is already planning and training for his next adventure, to take place in 2004: sailing from Sweden to Antarctica, skiing to the South Pole, and returning--all solo. That he is only just learning to sail doesn't dissuade him--"I like to jump headfirst into new projects." <i>Ultimate High</i> is proof that he's determined--and crazy--enough to complete them. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>Ultimate High</b><br>My Everest Odyssey<br><br>"On October 16, 1995, [Gï¿½ran Kropp] had left Stockholm on a custom-built bicycle loaded with 240 pounds of gear, intending to travel round-trip from sea level in Sweden to the top of Everest entirely under his own power, without Sherpa support or bottled oxygen.

In doing so, he would earn a place in the record books with the most self-contained combined approach and climb of Mount Everest ever accomplished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Kropp's Everest quest began 7,000 miles away, in Stockholm, where, at age twenty-nine, he set out by bicycle for Kathmandu, towing behind him nearly everything he'd need to live for a year. In this riveting first-person narrative, Kropp puts his own unique spin on the concept of adventure as he recounts his four-month trek across Europe and Asia, during which he was robbed, assaulted with a baseball bat, almost shot in Turkey, and nearly stoned in Iran. When he left the staging ground in Kathmandu in April 1996, he became the first ever to carry his equipment--all 143 pounds--up 17,100 feet to Everest Base Camp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Kropp's first attempt at scaling Everest unassisted ended in frustration when he was forced to turn back only 350 feet, one hour, from the summit, his strength drained, his morale crushed. Despite this setback, and in the face of rapidly deteriorating weather that would result in the deadliest season in Everest's history, Kropp steeled himself for a second attempt. Just days after the legendary storm that claimed the lives of eight climbers, he tried again and made it to the top of the world--without Sherpa aid, without bottled oxygen. Within a few days, he loaded up his bike for the equally harrowing 7,000-mile trek back to Stockholm.</p><h2>Paintings by J.

Milne were always on hand to reassure him that other children were just as puzzled and naughty and foolish as he was &#x2039; and that grown-ups could be even sillier. Now that he is sixty, he has decided itï¿½s high time there was an equally reassuring volume for those of his generation who are not only more confused than ever, but are losing their teeth, their hair and, all too often, their car keys. What he has done is take some of Milneï¿½s best-loved poems and rewritten them for sixty-year-olds, with results that are often hilarious, sometimes rueful, and always thought-provoking. The poems not only follow the familiar rhythms and rhyme schemes of the master, but reinvent that curious mixture of comedy and wistfulness, sharp observation and daft whimsy that has delighted children and adults for over seventy years.Apart from <i>Now We Are Sixty</i>, Christopher Matthew is best known for his <i>Diary of a Somebody</i> and its accident-prone hero Simon Crisp, whom Sheridan Morley called 'one of the greatest comic characters of our time'.

How the pain comes fluttering up in the joints, the pain permanent like new teeth. This is a moment of thresholds. The sound of doors swinging wildly somewhere in the wind.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The bridge across the song ma had long since been destroyed, but the little basket boat was still sitting on the near shore, bobbing in the current. There were no oars, just a series of guide ropes one could use to pull the bamboo boat back and forth. This was the last place she&#x2019;d seen him. More than eight months had passed. Little Mother still remembered the shape of Tu&#x2019;s neck under his hat as he pulled himself across the water, the birthmark gleaming on the edge of his hairline. They had walked to the river hand in hand through the dusk, the bats just starting to stir. Something buzzed in her ear, but she didn&#x2019;t swat it, not wanting him to remember her as anything less than stoic, Little Mother eager to demonstrate that she would be all right in his absence. They both knew the time had come for him to disappear, the war changing the land around them. As he slipped across the Song Ma, Tu didn&#x2019;t look back. The sound of water lapped against the sides of the boat as he melted into the landscape, her heart slipping away from her body.<br> &nbsp;<br> Little Mother studied the sky. There was an hour left until sundown. The old medicine man had said it would come that night. There was nothing else to do. On the far shore the rope was fastened around an iron hook set deep in a rock. She found the other end where she had left it tied up to the roots of a mangrove tree. Water sloshed in the bottom of the boat, the water hot around her ankles as she stepped in. Swiftly she pulled herself across the river, though it was mostly the current that carried her. The water coursed so dull red and matte she couldn&#x2019;t see anything in it, not even her own reflection.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the other side of the river she stepped out of the boat and crawled hand over hand up the bank. Just five months ago there had been a cluster of families living on both sides of the Song Ma. The families had made their living fishing and ferrying people and goods across the river. For the past few months the charred remains of their huts dotted the shoreline. Over time the blackened heaps looked less and less like the remains of houses. It was hard to say who&#x2019;d done it with any certainty. Little Mother took a deep breath and held it as she hurried past without looking. The patriarch had gone running back into one of the burning huts to find his granddaughter, the thatched roof like a woman with her hair on fire. Neither the old man nor the girl were ever seen again. Little Mother half remembered meeting the little girl from time to time, her hair done in two mismatched braids, one longer than the other, a space where her front tooth was missing, the head of the new tooth just starting to show. The grandfather had been a fisherman. He was known far and wide for fishing with a snow-white cormorant, the bird an albino, its eyes a bloody pink. Until the fire, most nights the grandfather and the bird could be seen together floating on a simple raft, the old man&#x2019;s long gray beard in stark contrast to his bald head. In the weekly market Little Mother had heard that the man and his granddaughter were somewhere still walking the earth. She imagined meeting the two of them, the blue flames of their spirits roaming restlessly through the dark. From the look of things, with the next good rain the last of the wreckage would wash down into the river, everything as if nobody had ever lived there.<br><br>***<br><br> A half mile down the road Little Mother came across the carcass of a wild sow. Its teats gleamed like big brown buttons up and down its bloated gut. Most likely the creature had eaten something poisonous. There was no noticeable trauma, though its mouth gaped, its yellowed tusks long as fingers where the gums had receded. Little Mother wondered if she herself looked like that&#x2014;gums drawn so far back her teeth as if twice as long.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the trunk of a black palm she stopped to rest. In the distance the Truong Son Mountains were hazy with ash. It happened often enough that she had learned to sleep through it, the nightly rumble of distant planes. Each time it started, the night sky would light up. The next morning ash would shower down, a black confetti floating as far as Qui Nhon on the coast.<br><br> ***<br><br> The moon was just on the edge of the horizon as Little Mother rounded the final bend, the sugar apples coming into view in the yard. The one-room she shared with Bï¿½ was west of the Song Ma in the southern corner of the province. The first few months of her marriage things had been quiet. Then a small weapons cache was found buried in a field outside Hau Bon. The farmer said he hadn&#x2019;t worked the field in years, that he left it fallow as a place for the spirits of the rice to live, and that everyone for miles around knew it, but he was carted off to Pleiku anyway. After that, everything changed. Evenings she would see people floating through the hamlet she had never seen before, their accents hard to place. Across the Song Ma a village chief was killed. Someone draped a sign around his neck. puppet. Then one by one Tu and the other men of fighting age disappeared, some like Tu joining the Vietcong out in the jungle, others just slipping away. The bombings in the Truong Son Mountains began to physically change their topography, the peaks leveled, helicopters landing at all hours. And now the whole fifty square miles west of the river had been declared a free-fire zone. The Americans ordered everyone out. Tu said the Americans were trying to stamp out the Vietcong by banishing the local people. No people meant no food, no aid. In a free-fire zone the Americans could shoot without asking. Anyone remaining was assumed to be VC. Bï¿½ had begged Little Mother to stay, saying they would be all right because they were harmless, two women in the middle of nowhere, and besides, how else would Tu know where to find them when he returned from the jungle? Most of the other villagers had left for Cong Heo, the strategic hamlet in Binh Dinh Province, though Cong Heo had long since fallen into disuse. Little Mother had heard there was a wooden fence with razor wire running along the top, a ring of bamboo stakes all around the compound, the stakes gone soft with rot.<br> &nbsp;<br> As she entered the yard, she could see the door was open. Inside, a fire was burning in the fire pit, but the room was empty except for their few possessions&#x2014;some cooking utensils and a pair of rice bowls stacked on a small table, Bï¿½&#x2019;s hammock strung up under the window. The tin bucket they used to collect water from the creek on the other side of the orchard was missing, a ring left in the dirt where the bucket usually sat. Little Mother picked up her sleeping mat and unrolled it on the floor. Slowly she eased herself down and took off her <i>non la</i>. The money was there, but the flower was gone, its little pink bud like a mouth. She took a deep breath and held the hat up to the fire, searching it with her eyes for the words Tu had paid for, had chosen just for her, and how the artist had painstakingly woven them through the lining. <i>In the long river, fish swim off without a trace. </i>How the local people believed that a girl who wore a conical hat laced with poetry would become milder, more gentle, the girl effectively domesticated.

And when he failed to impress, whether on the football team, in math class, in the Navy or on the job, he simply gave up. A true tour-de-force, THE QUITTER is the universal tale of a young man's search for himself through the frustrations, redemptions and complexities of ordinary life.With gritty, atmospheric artwork by indie-comics luminary Dean Haspiel (American Splendor, Opposable Thumbs), THE QUITTER is both Pekar's funniest and most heart-wrenching work yet, an unforgettable graphic novel for all those, like Pekar, who have tried, failed and lived to quit another day.</p><p>Cleveland, Ohio native <b>Harvey Pekar</b> is best known for his autobiographical slice-of-life comic book series <i>American Splendor</i>, a first-person account of Pekar&#x2019;s downtrodden life. The series has been published on an approximately annual basis since 1976. In 1987, Pekar was honored with the American Book Award for the series. The series was the inspiration for the film starring Paul Giamatti.<br><br><b>Dean Haspiel</b> is the creator of the Eisner Award-nominated&nbsp;<i>Billy Dogma&nbsp;</i>and the webcomics collective&nbsp;ACT-I-VATE.

He lives in Brooklyn.*Starred Review* Pekar's autobiographical <i>American Splendor</i> contained glimpses of its author's earliest years during its long run, but the whole story had to wait for this graphic novel written from the vantage of retirement age. As usual in his work, the present-day Pekar appears to comment on the narrative a la George Burns on his and Gracie Allen's TV sitcom, though Pekar emphasizes apology, not wisecracks. Born to Polish Jews in Cleveland months before war broke out in Europe, Pekar had to become a fighter as a small boy and later used fighting for status in high school. He also became a quitter of things he didn't immediately excel at and an avoider of others he thought he couldn't hack. Fortunately, he discovered jazz, and when college and the navy proved impossible for him, encouragement from jazz critic Ira Gitler launched him into jazz commentary, the first of his two major avocations. Friendship with young Robert Crumb revived a boyhood interest in comics, and that jump-started the second. Meanwhile, he settled down to being a lifelong U.S. government file clerk. He still obsesses about being inadequate and unprepared. Ably abetted by gray-toner Lee Loughridge, Dean Haspiel renders Pekar's conception like a more angular, frame-boundary-obeying Will Eisner. Since this is the story of a Jewish immigrants' son, Haspiel's echoes of the greatest graphic novelist of American Jewry are brilliantly appropriate. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

They have three children.1<br><br>The Project<br><br>This project began with my realization that it was time to finally figure out whether we were going to be comfortable in retirement or miserable.<br><br>Going into it, I knew that we were pretty fortunate compared with many Americans. As I've said, I have always worked for companies that pay reasonably well and that provide pensions. Those pensions have been fully funded, at least within the legal definition. Those companies have also sponsored retirement plans for employees and encouraged them to build 401(k) accounts with matching contributions, and I have done that. Also, I've been able to hold on to jobs over the years in a business that's seen plenty of layoffs. Our household budgets have been tight, but aside from that ill-fated apartment purchase in our 30s, our family hasn't suffered the kind of financial setback or catastrophic illness that destroy many a family's nest egg.<br><br>We knew we had something tucked away. But was that something enough? Thanks to the recent sale of a house we had lived in for 15 years, we had some financial breathing room, at least for a while. But I had no idea where we stood in terms of being able to retire someday. I'd all but stopped looking at the envelopes from Vanguard after 2007, when my funds lost about 40 percent of their value-not an outrageous dip in the context of the broader economic crisis and recession, but a searing one for me. As a sometime financial reporter, I knew enough to not sell stocks during a sell-off, so I didn't compound the damage with a panic sale. Besides, I've always found it easy not to do anything; sloth comes naturally to me.<br><br>I figured that the accounts had bounced back to some extent, but hadn't been tracking them closely. And I had no idea how long such funds would last once I stopped getting a paycheck. A gnawing feeling in my gut convinced me at last that this was the year to get our finances together. Maybe past time, if the numbers didn't come out right. And while I hope to have good years of productive work ahead, I also have to think about retirement and plan for it-to look at whether I'm on the right track, and to begin addressing some of the other issues that I'd been avoiding all these years.<br><br>Where to start? With an industry built around retirement planning, I was faced with the paralysis of too much choice and too little knowledge. How do I find a retirement consultant? Those who work on commission might be tempted to sell financial products that increase their incomes, not mine. And those who charge a flat fee might try to keep things quick and easy (for them) to ensure that their time is efficiently used. I had no intention of being a quick hit on somebody's conveyor belt.<br><br>As it happens, the 401(k) accounts I built up at the three publications I have worked for over the last 30 years are all under the same roof, the mutual funds giant Vanguard. That promised to make things relatively easy, and the company offers free counseling from a certified financial planner to clients of employer-sponsored plans who are over 55.<br><br>So one evening in January, I made the call to Vanguard's 800 number. After navigating the voice-command system, I ended up talking to an upbeat guy named Jeff, who told me that I could either set up an appointment for a phone session with one of their certified financial planners, or I could get a more thorough counseling session by first filling out an online questionnaire that would give the planner a "more holistic view" of my financial picture before our conversation. The result, he said, would be a "personalized financial plan."<br><br>Filling out the document "takes about 45 minutes," he said.<br><br>As I hung up, Jeanne, sitting across the living room on the couch, asked, "Any luck?"<br><br>I told her about the 45-minute questionnaire and said, "We can fill it out together."<br><br>"Thrilling," she said.<br><br>The very first question stumped me. It asked the age I plan to retire.<br><br>Well, see, this is part of the problem. That is precisely the kind of question I've been avoiding all these years. Jeanne and I had never discussed it. I love my job-journalism is a career that calls for hard work, but it rarely feels like work. So we were starting with a big, big question. (Jeanne has worked part-time for years, so her decision would have less impact on our retirement picture.)<br><br>We knew that Social Security has traditionally kicked in at 62, but that you could earn more if you hold out longer-say, until 66. Medicare begins at 65. And after hunting around online, it appeared that sticking with gainful employment until 70 would lead to the biggest Social Security benefit. Jeanne, a pragmatist, noted ominously, "Your retirement isn't under your control, entirely." My employer has a lot to say about it. But we could project a best case, and decided that sticking it out to 70 would be the likeliest course to set us up in terms of our investments, Social Security, and pensions. Besides, even if I got booted out of one job, I could probably still find a way to keep earning; many of my friends at the Times had moved on to fulfilling careers on the outside. Seventy it would be.<br><br>Okay. So we had an answer! Success!<br><br>"So that was question number one?" Jeanne asked. Yes, I said.<br><br>She laughed. "That was more than 45 minutes."<br><br>Okay, it was going to be a long night. The first answer had taken so long that the Vanguard website had logged me out for inactivity. I went back in, entered the answer. And soon came to an ever more difficult question: How long do you expect to live?<br><br>Well, holy guacamole. Let me check my appointment book! We had moved abruptly from economics to metaphysics, or at least actuarial science.<br><br>Here, too, however, we decided to plan for a good outcome while understanding that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune could make best estimates meaningless. Our four parents were still going strong in their 80s and 90s. My father, at 91, was still working as a lobbyist in the 2016 session of the Texas legislature. He'd laugh at the idea of quitting at 70. So we again filled in some rather optimistic estimates and then marched on through questions that were pretty obviously intended to measure my tolerance for investment risk: whether I was likely to sell stocks in a market downturn (no), whether I would invest in a fund based on a casual conversation or tip (heck, no), and suchlike.<br><br>Then came another stumper: What percentage of our income would we hope to receive in retirement? Searching through financial websites, I found that many people look for about 70 or 80 percent of their working income in retirement. The assumption is that retirees will live less expensively than they did in their more active years. So once again, I plugged in yet another guess, based on yet another rule of thumb that I hadn't known moments before.<br><br>As Jeanne and I discussed these things, I realized we had never really talked about whatever passed for my investment strategy. I offered to describe mine, such as it is. But she cut me off, saying, "My strategy is not to know your strategy."<br><br>I was gratified by her level of trust in me but wondered whether it was justified. And whether she was just trying to shut me up. Still, I did my best to express my amorphous thoughts on investing. I explained that I'd been skeptical of financial advice programs about hardcore investing by gurus like Jim Cramer. I never felt that I was the kind of guy who could beat the market. That's how I came up with my laissez-faire approach. I had a hard time remembering how much of my income I had assigned to the funds 14 years before, when I came to the Times. (After doing some research, I discovered that it was 10 percent, the same portion of my income I'd maintained during my years at Newsweek and The Washington Post.)<br><br>Jeanne said, "I approve." Which, after more than 40 years together, is nice to hear.<br><br>Proceeding through the questionnaire, I then had to track down what we could expect to receive from Social Security each month at age 70-a pretty easy figure to find from ssa.gov-and what my various pensions might bring in. That process could not be handled from my easy chair, as I had to ask former employers to come up with estimates. One would answer during the course of a single phone call; the other took weeks to calculate an estimate and send it by mail. Anticipating a slog, I decided I'd had enough for the night.<br><br>When I shut my laptop, four hours had passed from the time I had started the survey, and I was far from done. But we were thinking about the right questions at last.<br><br>The next day, Jeanne sent me an email mentioning a conversation she'd had with a coworker who had asked "a quality-of-life question." If you wait until you are 70 to retire, you might get a bigger payout, but will you be in any condition to enjoy it?<br><br>I responded: "An excellent question. If 70 is the new 50, yes. If 70 is the old 70, no."<br><br>Our parents, as I said, had been very young 70-year-olds. It seemed like a safe bet. But I decided to ask the counselor to look at the numbers under a couple of different retirement ages.<br><br>Over the next few days, I gathered the final bits of information about what my pensions from various employers would amount to and finished the form. Soon after that, Vanguard came back with a report generated from my answers. It said I should be more heavily invested in bonds; considering my age, the report stated, I had too much money in stocks. Vanguard's quarterly mailings had been telling me that for a while, so this advice was no surprise. But then I saw words that seemed to levitate off the page:<br><br>You're on track to meet your retirement goals.<br><br>It was a beautiful thing. If we continued the way we were going, if the financial markets didn't collapse, if the magical fairies that govern employment and health were good to us, we would make it. I was, frankly, surprised. Jeanne was exultant. She said, "We won't be eating cat food!"<br><br>But, of course, there were uncertainties. The document from Vanguard presented three scenarios for my portfolio over time, based on past U.S. market performance: best, average, and worst. The worst-case scenario left us with $800,000, well below what we'd need for a comfortable draw-down from our 401(k) in retirement. The best-case was ridiculously high: nearly $4 million. The average scenario put us at about $2 million, which should make for a comfortable retirement. But which will it be? There's no way to tell. It's still a game of if, if, if.<br><br>A week later, I had the conversation with the financial adviser, an upbeat guy named Greg. We discussed how to get on what he somewhat ominously called the "glide path" to a more balanced portfolio for retirement.<br><br>He explained that the allocation between stocks and bonds mentioned in the report was actually a big deal-"the most important one you make as an investor," even bigger than deciding what funds we invest in, since bonds help cushion your investments against stock market drops. "When things are bad, your drops are not as extreme. So your recovery doesn't have to be as extreme," he said. I didn't have a lot of my money in bonds; the recommended percentage at my age (and considering my aptitude for risk from the questions I'd answered) was about 35 percent in bonds and 65 percent in stocks. I told him that I'd take a hard look at shifting the balance toward more bonds.<br><br>He also wanted to talk about some of the mutual funds I'd been invested in since starting to save 30 years before, and noted that several of them were funds run by fund managers and based on research in the markets, with higher rates than I would pay if I put more of my assets into so-called index funds, which are based on market indexes like the Standard &amp; Poor 500. While much of my portfolio was already in such an index fund, he explained that I could make more money by putting more of my assets into lower-fee index funds. The report from Vanguard had recommended a number of index funds the company offers that focus on large companies, midsize companies, and international companies. It all went by pretty fast, but I caught most of it.<br><br>He didn't push me on any of these proposed changes-he told me that I could shift the assets myself, when I was ready, from my home computer. The report that Vanguard had generated recommended some of those funds, and I could use those or find others, he said. Most important, changing funds within Vanguard would cost me nothing-"no asset-transfer fees," he said. Sweet!<br><br>He also explained what we could expect if I wanted to shorten my time working and retire in my 60s. His estimates put us a little closer to the margins-less travel, buying cheaper cuts of meat-but he suggested that our current portfolio could, barring ill fortune, deliver us to comfort if not prosperity.<br><br>It felt good to be done.<br><br>But we weren't, of course. This was only the beginning. We plugged a bunch of hypothetical numbers into a model and got a nice picture back. Much was still left to chance. Every decision led to others, and opening one door led to even more doors. I would have to make decisions about whether to buy more bonds and whether to move more of our assets into index funds. And beyond our retirement planning, we still had so much to do to be able to say we'd gotten our financial life in order. We still did not have a will. I still needed to look at my level of life insurance to make sure the family would be covered if that bus found me. And there were things like medical directives: if either of us became incapacitated, under what circumstances would we want someone to pull the plug, and then what to do with our potentially useful organs? And more and more. Answering the next questions wasn't going to give us control over the future, either, but it might offer a buffer against misfortune.<br><br>The project wasn't over.

Olive Senior&#39;s new collection of stories, The Pain Tree, is wide-ranging in scope, time period, theme, locale and voice. Her characteristic &#39;gossipy voice&#39; is present in many of the stories, but as well there is reverence, wit and wisdom, along with satire, humour and even farce. The stories range over almost a hundred years, from around the time of the second world war to the present. Like her earlier stories, Jamaica is the setting but the range of characters presented are universally recognisable as people in crisis or on the cusp of transformation. While most of the stories operate within a realist mode, Senior in this collection is also exploiting traditional motifs, so we have collected here revenge stories (&#39;The Goodness of my Heart&#39;), a bargain with the Devil (&#39;Boxed-in&#39;), a Cinderella story (&#39;The Country Cousin&#39;), a magical realist interpretation of African spiritual beliefs (&#39;Flying&#39;) and a narrator&#39;s belated acceptance of the healing power of traditional beliefs (&#39;The Pain Tree&#39;). &#39;Coal&#39; is a realist story set in the war years and depression that followed as folks try to find a new place in the world. Senior&#39;s trademark children awakening to self-awareness and to the hypocracy of adults are here too, from the heartbreaking &#39;Moonlight&#39; and &#39;Silent&#39; to the girls in &#39;Lollipop&#39; and &#39;A Father Like That&#39; who learn to confront loneliness and vulnerability with attitude.</p><p>Olive Senior is the prize-winning author of a dozen books of fiction, poetry and non-fiction. Her short story collection <i>Summer Lightning</i> (Longman, 1986) won the inaugural Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book, and her poetry collection <i>Over the Roofs of the World</i> (Insomniac, 2005) was a finalist for the 2005 Governor General's Literary Award for poetry. Born in Jamaica, she has travelled widely and now spends most of her time in Jamaica and Toronto.&#x201c;At every level of her stories&#x2019; constructions, Senior works deftly ... dealing with open palms in the deep wells of remembrance, ancestry and a crosshatch of colonising scars, this fiction looks face-upwards to the mountains of multiple Jamaicas for hope, home and daily bread.&#x201d; (<i>The Trinidad Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The magic of Olive Senior&#x2019;s stories is that they weather time with uncommon power. In these collected short fictions, published and broadcast in various incarnations from the 1990s forward, the concerns of class, language, identity, and refuge reign, explored in prose that is all the more commanding for its subtle navigations.&#x201d; (<i>Caribbean Beat</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[Senior&#x2019;s] prose is supple and ornate ... there is technique aplenty.&#x201d; (<i>Quill and Quire</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[Its] voices are authentic &#x2013; a variety of rhythms and cadences appear on the page &#x2013; and Olive Senior pulls readers into quiet moments of transformation with considerable emotional intensity.

This book has a great balance of both cardis and pullovers with a few accessories like a cowl, shawl and fingerless mitts thrown in coming to total of 20 patterns. I liked the yarn choices and the palette was nicely paired with the photo location. All of the garments would be ideal wardrobe staples and are classic enough that they can be worn for years to come.

During this time he survived the dangers of disease and warfare, including the disastrous First Anglo-Afghan War. A gifted linguist, fascinated by history and exploration, he became obsessed with cuneiform, the world's earliest writing. An immense inscription high on a sheer rock face at Bisitun in the mountains of western Iran, carved on the orders of King Darius the Great of Persia over 2,000 years ago, was the key to understanding the many cuneiform scripts and languages. Only Rawlinson had the physical and intellectual skills, courage, self-motivation and opportunity to make the perilous ascent and copy the monument. <br><br>Here, Lesley Adkins relates the story of Rawlinson's life and how he triumphed in deciphering the lost languages of Persia and Babylonia, overcoming his brilliant but bitter rival, Edward Hincks. While based in Baghdad, Rawlinson became involved in the very first excavations of the ancient mounds of Mesopotamia, from Nineveh to Babylon, an area that had been fought over by so many powerful empires. His decipherment of the inscriptions resurrected unsuspected civilizations, revealing intriguing details of everyday life and forgotten historical events. By proving to the astonished Victorian public that people and places in the Old Testament really existed (and, furthermore, that documents and chronicles had survived from well before the writing of the Bible), Rawlinson became a celebrity and assured his own place in history.<br></p><p>Lesley Adkins, an archaeologist and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, is the author of several reference books as well as <i>The Keys of Egypt: The Race to Read the Hieroglyphs</i>, the account of the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. She lives in Devon, England, and is married to Roy Adkins, also an archaeologist and writer.<br>What Franï¿½ois Champollion was to Egyptian hieroglyphics, Henry Rawlinson was to Babylonian cuneiform. In 1833 Rawlinson was a brash, courageous and talented young British military officer and amateur philologist posted in Persia. He eagerly&#x2014;and at great personal risk&#x2014;devoted himself to the first comprehensive study of the famed cuneiform inscriptions at Bisitun, which covered a remote cliff face as large as a football field, having been commissioned circa 515 B.C. by Darius I of Persia as a personal monument. Over the course of 30 years, punctuated by a breathless succession of military campaigns, political intrigue and instability during which he earned honor and fame, Rawlinson pursued with dogged serenity the deciphering of the cuneiform pictographs. He benefited from the similarly dedicated efforts of a small fraternity of like-minded scholars(though competitive rivalries would embitter the fraternity). Adkins, a British author of several books on archeology and antiquity, admits this biography is limited. Rawlinson the man never comes to life. What must have been a fascinating and even passionate pursuit is only dimly illuminated. Dedicated philologists may rejoice, but for readers seeking a more human story, the man who solved the enigma of cuneiform remains undeciphered. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by <i>PW</i>, 3 maps. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The year is 1941, and the good people of Leningrad are squeezed between fear of Stalin's secret police and rumors that the Germans, despite the incredulity of military experts, are rapidly advancing on their great city. When the inevitable happens, 22-year-old Anna, an artist and the sole support for her young brother, invalid father, and the latter's former mistress, learns to survive the devastation and mass starvation that the siege brings. In the worst days of winter, Anna falls in love with a doctor, Andrei, who returns her passion, creating an oasis of emotional privacy within the hell of war. <i>The Siege</i> is expertly anchored in sometimes unbearable details of the assault on Leningrad; the book's sense of place and the author's great skill at pumping immediacy into the cold facts is something to behold. But this is, finally, a novel about extremes of experience, from rampant cruelty to the redemptive power of one person's love. <i>--Tom Keogh</i>Few things are more affecting to read than the well-crafted war novel. THE SIEGE is especially harrowing because of its focus on civilian casualties, the people held captive during the siege of Leningrad in 1941. Jilly Bond follows the Levin family, first through its regular routine, then through its plunge into the devastation of WWII as it creeps toward them and changes their lives forever. Despite its brutal subject matter, this is a beautifully written novel with phrases that will haunt the listener with their subtlety. Bond's British accent proves a flexible, appropriate vehicle for this exceptional prose.

His nine-volume chronicle of America from 1800 to 1816 established new standards for employing archival sources, firsthand reportage, eyewitness accounts, and other techniques that have become the essence of modern history.<br><br>Ambitious in scope, nuanced in detail, Henry Adams and the Making of America throws brilliant light on the historian and the making of history.</p><p>GARRY WILLS, a distinguished historian and critic, is the author of numerous books, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning Lincoln at Gettysburg, Saint Augustine, and the best-selling Why I Am a Catholic. A regular contributor to the New York Review of Books, he has won many awards, among them two National Book Critics Circle Awards and the 1998 National Medal for the Humanities. He is a history professor emeritus at Northwestern University.As a chronicler of our national past, the prolific Garry Wills bites off big chews: Washington's character, Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. And now we have this fascinating book on Henry Adams's titanic work, nine volumes in total, History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson and History of the United States of America During the Administrations of James Madison: titles as ponderous as Wills's book itself is lithe and stimulating. <p> Indeed, Adams's mouthful of a title just may account in part for the History's perennial neglect, even by literate students of American history. When in 1888 Adams delivered the first six volumes, he estimated that he had spent $20,000 out of his own pocket researching U.S. and European archives. He valued his decade-long labor at an additional $60,000. The initial sales and royalties ($5,300) fell far short of retrieving his investment. That, along with the 1885 suicide of his cherished wife, Clover, may have brought on the darker mood that marked his later decades and his equally distinguished (and far more famous) autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams. As Wills observes, that later mood may explain the misconceptions that have lingered about the History from the outset.</p><p> In Part I, Wills shows how Adams prepared himself to essay a masterwork of Gibbon-esque reach -- a classic narrative history in the grand 18th- and 19th-century manner, offering a day-to-day account that simultaneously tells a story of large thematic scope about the emerging republic. He had served as his father's secretary in the U.S. mission to London during the Civil War. Before that, he had reported as a journalist (with matchless sources) during the "secession winter" of 1861. He had taught medieval history at Harvard and for six years had edited the North American Review, the most important journal of the post-Civil War period. Not least, he was the grandson and great-grandson of the Adams presidents -- and heir through them to a legacy of historical consciousness.</p><p> That family heritage, however, was also a liability that has tended to impair an accurate reading of the History, viewed by some historians and readers as an attempt to vindicate Adams's presidential ancestors and their Federalist principles. As Wills shows, this is a flagrant misconception. The fact is that Henry Adams had strong reservations about the Adams presidents. He personally disliked his formidable grandfather, John Quincy, but venerated his grandmother, Louisa Johnson Adams, who (though English-born) came of Maryland stock on her father's side and seemed a far more congenial character. Wills makes much -- perhaps a shade too much -- of Adams's self-identification with his grandmother as a sort of honorary Southerner. There can be no doubt, however, that Adams's editing of her diaries and letters contributed to his understanding of Jefferson and Madison and his grasp of what Adams calls the "Virginia" political outlook. </p><p> A big, thick pudding of a history needs a savory theme, and Adams had one. He set out to show how the United States of 1800, riven by faction and sectionalism at an important moment of transition, transformed itself under two presidencies into the thriving nation that emerged from the War of 1812. For Adams, it was a classic comedy (worthy of Beaumarchais) in which Jeffersonian ideals of minimalist government were confounded by events. The Jeffersonians, with their severely constricted notions of the proper scope of government, were thrust by fortune and a succession of remote steps (beginning with Napoleon's whimsical decision to sell Louisiana) toward a centralized and nationalist policy. Wills emphasizes, as Adams did, the role of Napoleon in American fortunes; indeed, Adams was the first major American historian to set the early story of the republic's development in its European context. Left to his own devices, Wills comments, Jefferson "would recall embassies, put the navy to sleep, get rid of all taxes but customs duties, and give himself little to do." None of it happened, much as the minimalist Jefferson might have wished; the world rudely intruded.</p><p> Henry Adams and the Making of America is original in both conception and execution. Watching one of our best historians address himself to a masterpiece of U.S. history is especially welcome at a time of gathering historical amnesia in which bad teaching from laundered textbooks has left so many of us bored by our past and ignorant of it.</p><p> That said, a few reservations. As in his previous books, Wills emerges as a quick study of whatever he sets his hand to, raking more fresh material from one book or document than drier writers do from whole library shelves. The effect is often dazzling, which is one secret of his charm as a writer. But he tends to draw from his fresh discoveries the occasionally misleading impression that he is the first to chart a given terrain. (One recalls the suggestion by Mr. Dooley, the barroom pundit with a thick brogue invented by the humorist Peter Finley Dunne, that Theodore Roosevelt's account of the Spanish-American War should be called "Alone in Cubia.") But Wills isn't always "alone in Cubia," and he certainly isn't alone in his appreciation of Adams's History. This minor irritant might be overlooked except that the compulsion to be original even when he is merely tendentious is a recurrent thread in Wills's otherwise engaging work.</p><p> "Can these people not read?" he asks in exasperation about one scholar's alleged misinterpretation of Adams's mini-biography of Randolph of Roanoke. He asks the same question of other explorers of the History. Well, yes; others can indeed read, though their responses may differ. Wills claims in this book to be retrieving the true themes of the History from the widespread misunderstanding that the work is an apologia for the Adams presidents, but he overlooks distinguished predecessors -- notably Herbert Agar and George Dangerfield -- whose grasp of the themes of the great work is hardly inferior to his own. The brighter side of the same coin is Wills's knack for illuminating neglected historical nooks and crannies, as in his celebration of the genius of Joshua Humphreys, the naval architect whose fine frigates -- six of them, built under Federalist rule before Jefferson tried to dry-dock the Navy -- were crucial to national pride and prowess in the War of 1812.</p><p> An occasional error of detail notwithstanding -- for instance, the English historian John Richard Green, Adams's friend and model, was not a medievalist, and his connection with the Oxford historical school was tenuous -- Wills achieves here a palpable hit. Writer and subject are beautifully matched. The result is a sparkling and engaging book that everyone who cares about American history should read; in its pages, they can reacquaint themselves with a masterly narrative explaining how the United States, after shaky beginnings, became a nation of consequence. And after the delicious appetizer, by all means try the main course itself: Henry Adams's nonpareil History. Nothing better of its kind has ever been written on these shores. </p><p>Reviewed by Edwin M. Yoder Jr. <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

This visually stunning underwater adventure follows eventful and comic journeys of two fish-a father and his son Nemo-who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef. The underwater world for the film was conceptualized and developed by the creative team of artists, illustrators, and designers at Pixar, resulting in a lush landscape rich with detail. The Art of Finding Nemo celebrates their talent, featuring concept and character sketches, storyboards, and lighting studies in a huge spectrum of media, from five-second sketches to intricate color pastels. This behind-the-scenes odyssey invites the reader into the elaborate creative process of animation films through interviews with all the key players at Pixar. There will be childrens books related to Finding Nemo, but no adult titles other than this definitive volume. Revealing, insightful, and awesomely creative, The Art of Finding Nemo will delight film-goers, artists, and animation fans alike.</p><p>Mark Cotta Vaz recently completed his 19th book, a biography of Merian C.

Not so Mark Cotta Vaz's coffee-table book THE ART OF FINDING NEMO which happily isn't a by-the-numbers look at how the hit film was made. Instead Vaz focuses on the illuminating concept art that inspired the digital artists at Pixar. And the result is magical. The artists were able to use a draft of the script as their blueprint (rare in animated films), and it paid huge dividends. <br>In many ways the concept art surpasses the digital art of the movie itself. There's an emotional (not sentimental), articulated depth to the work, particularly in the pastels and the charcoal renderings (by production designer Ralph Eggleston and Simon Varela, respectively) that digital art - for all the technology involved - simply cannot match. So cheer the movie's accomplishments and heart, but let the astonishing art included here flood your mind. - <b>Premiere</b></p><h2>The Dynamics of Bureaucracy: A Study of Interpersonal Relations in Two Government Agencies.</h2><p>The book is solidly good.

Goubert's research is entirely interdisciplinary, and his procedure is highly original. The first in his field, the author has at all points built up a study which never departs from its faithfulness to texts, documents and facts."--From the introduction</p><br><p>This book is the first major study of the social and cultural conquest of water during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Jean-Pierre Goubert discloses the changing meanings of everyday reality as he explores the transition from water-scarce cultures, in which water was a sacred symbol, to the secularization and then the mass democratization of the water supply. He imaginatively discusses almost every area of life in which water plays a role, using a variety of sources from advertising to government records to interviews. Goubert examines the development of a body of scientific and technical knowledge about water and the range of water policies designed to prevent mass typhoid epidemics and to raise health standards in general. He demonstrates how the new role of water in the preservation of health was vigorously promoted by education, medicine, and the media. Finally, he makes it clear that water has conquered us as much as we have conquered it, in the sense that our civilization has been transformed by water and has become dependent on vast and immediately available quantities of that crucial substance for both personal and industrial use.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Freedom in the Western World</h2><p>EDNT|First Edition THIS BOOK IN STOCK &amp; WILL SHIP SAME DAY!

Jeffrey Record reviews eleven insurgent wars from 1775 to the present and determines why the seemingly weaker side won. He concludes that external assistance correlates more consistently with insurgent success than any other explanation. He does not disparage the critical importance of will, strategy, and strong-side regime type or suggest that external assistance guarantees success. Indeed, in all cases, some combination of these factors is usually present. But Record finds few if any cases of unassisted insurgent victories except against the most decrepit regimes. <br><br>Having identified the ingredients of insurgent success, Record examines the present insurgency in Iraq and whether the United States can win. In so doing, Record employs a comparative analysis of the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. He also identifies and assesses the influence of distinctive features of the American way of war on the U.S. forces&#x2019; performance against the Iraqi insurgency. <br><br>Make no mistake: insurgent victories are the exception, not the rule. But when David does beat Goliath, the consequences can be earth shattering and change the course of history. Jeffrey Record&#x2019;s persuasive logic and clear writing make this timely book a must read for scholars, policymakers, military strategists, and anyone interested in the Iraq War&#x2019;s outcome. <br></p><p><p>"The United States would be better off if more people read Jeffrey Record's insightful analysis--especially people in power. His analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the American way of war is by itself worth the price of the book." <b>-- Thomas E. Ricks, author of <i>Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq</i></b> </p><p>"<i>Beating Goliath</i> is short, clear, interesting, and practical--that is, everything a book designed to change minds should be. It is also full of arguments and conclusions that will surprise many readers and would greatly improve America's decisions about when and how to commit military force. This is a valuable book for military professionals and the intelligent non-expert public alike." <b>-- James Fallows, author of <i>Blind Into Baghdad</i> and <i>National Defense </i></b> </p><p>"<i>Beating Goliath</i> is a small book that packs a big wallop. Jeffrey Record's explanation as to why insurgencies pose such a daunting challenge for powerful nations--especially for the United States--is succinct, incisive, and compelling." <b>-- Andrew J. Bacevich, professor of history and international relations, Boston University, and author of the <i>New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War </i></b> </p><p>"Through solid research and astute analysis, Dr. Record demonstrates that the United States is 'not particularly good' at precisely the type of armed conflict it expects to encounter in coming decades--counterinsurgency. This idea has immense repercussions for future American strategy.

At about fourteen she decided to study medicine. With her brother&#39;s help she learnt enough Greek and Latin to pass into the Gymnasium but her early engagement and subsequent marriage in 1903 brought a halt to her plans. Years later, discovering a booklet on dreams by Freud, she turned her attentions to psychoanalysis.

And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate PublisherThe ninth mystery featuring English professor Kate Fansler proves why Cross ( No Word from Winifred ) belongs at the top of her class: it is provocative, literate and insightful. During the Thanksgiving weekend, Canfield Adams, a Middle Eastern professor of culture and literature at the Manhattan university where Kate teaches, is found dead on the pavement seven stories below his office window. While everyone is convinced he was murdered, the only suspect in the case is another faculty member, black political activist Humphrey Edgerton, who has no alibi for the night of the crime. But Canfield was universally disliked. With the prospect of his widow filing a lawsuit against the university and the police inquiry at a standstill, the administration asks Kate to investigate. Before she can discover the culprit, a student who was seen in Canfield's building the day he was killed is pushed from her 10th floor apartment. Depressed by the young woman's death and overwhelmed by her impending failure, Kate faces her greatest challenge as an amateur sleuth. Cross, a keen observer of society, has created a potpourri of well-drawn female characters. This is a mystery offering much more than just a puzzle; it is a strong feminist statement abounding with interesting ideas. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains</h2><p>Shares Fremont&#39;s account of government sponsored expeditions to explore the American northwest</p><p></p><h2>How Mickey Made It</h2><p>Peich Toothpaste Press 64.

I had an eighth-grade teacher who recited "Snow-bound" with such dull zeal that I decided it was the most boring poem in American literature. Wineapple had a similar experience. "Later I realized I had been too young for the poem," she writes in a marvelous introduction, "and now I suspect that all the schoolchildren subjected to Whittier's assurances are themselves too callow to understand, never mind care, how memory fends off the mindlessness of winter." We had no idea Whittier was summoning a lost rural world against encroaching blankness, a world whiting out, "coldness visible."</p><p> I wish someone had pointed out to us that the 19th-century New England poet of place was also a fiery abolitionist and socially engaged protest poet. He was a Quaker with a wide reach and a deep social conscience. "Although I am a Quaker by birthright and sincere convictions," he said, "I am no sectarian in the strict sense of the term. My sympathies are with the Broad Church of Humanity."</p><p> Whittier is well-known as the popular Yankee storyteller of "Skipper Ireson's Ride," "Barbara Frietchie," and "Telling the Bees," but I wish more readers also knew his powerful abolitionist poems. He despised slavery, the scourge of our country ("I hate slavery in all its forms, degrees and influences," he wrote), and was threatened by mobs more than a few times. His best antislavery poems include the sardonic ballad "The Hunters of Men," "Songs of Slaves in the Desert" and "Ichabod!," a mournful lament and furious attack on Daniel Webster for supporting the Compromise of 1850, which included a new Fugitive Slave Law. Ichabod means "inglorious" in Hebrew, and Whittier applies it to Webster for betraying the anti-slavery cause.</p><p>Ichabod!</p><p>So fallen! so lost! the light withdrawn </p><p>Which once he wore!</p><p>The glory from his gray hairs gone </p><p> Forevermore!</p><p>Revile him not -- the Tempter hath </p><p> A snare for all;</p><p>And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath, </p><p> Befit his fall!</p><p>Oh! dumb be passion's stormy rage, </p><p> When he who might </p><p>Have lighted up and led his age, </p><p> Falls back in night.</p><p>Scorn!

Through her successive drives for gender equality, human rights, political reform, Taiwan independence, and, currently, environmental protection, Lu has played a key role in Taiwan's evolution from dictatorship to democracy. The election in 2000 of Democratic Progressive Party leader Chen Shui-bian to the presidency, with Lu as his vice president, ended more than fifty years of rule by the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party).<br><br>Taiwan's painful struggle for democratization is dramatized here in the life of Lu, a feminist leader and pro-democracy advocate who was imprisoned for more than five years in the 1980s. Unlike such famous Asian women politicians as Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi, India's Indira Gandhi, and Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto, Lu Hsiu-lien grew up in a family without political connections.

Only twelve years old, yet the kid had a brain that people would kill to have. I mustn&#x2019;t appear too eager, he thought. Must keep calm. We want him at Princeton&#x2014;preferably chained to a computer and not allowed out for meals.<br> <br>Ostensibly, he had been sent to Denver to interview several scholarship candidates, but the truth was, this boy was the only one the admissions office was truly interested in, and the meeting had been set to the boy&#x2019;s convenience. The department dean had arranged with an old friend to borrow office space that was in a part of town close to the boy&#x2019;s very middle-class house so he could get there by bike.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ahem,&#x201d; the man said, clearing his throat and frowning at the papers. He deepened his voice. Better not let the kid know that he was only twenty-five and that if he messed up this assignment, he could be in serious trouble with his advisers.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are quite young,&#x201d; he said, trying to sound as old as possible, &#x201c;and there will be difficulties, but I think we can handle your special circumstances. Princeton likes to help the young people of America. And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of equipment do you have? What will I have to work with? There are other schools making me offers.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the man looked at the boy, he thought someone should have strangled him in his crib. Ungrateful little&#x2014; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure that you&#x2019;ll find what we have adequate, and if we do not have everything you need, we can make it available.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy was tall for his age but thin, as though he were growing too fast for his weight to catch up with him. For all that he had one of the great brains of the century, he looked like something out of Tom Sawyer: dark hair that no comb could tame, freckles across skin that would never tan, dark blue eyes behind glasses big enough to be used as a windshield on a Mack truck.<br> <br>Elijah J. Harcourt, the file said. IQ over 200. Had made much progress on coming up with a computer that could think. Artificial intelligence. You could tell the computer what you wanted to do and the machine could figure out how to do it. As far as anyone could tell, the boy was putting his prodigious brain inside a computer. The future uses of such an instrument were beyond comprehension.<br> <br>Yet here the smug little brat sat, not grateful for what was being offered to him but demanding more. The man knew he was risking his own career, but he couldn&#x2019;t stand the hesitancy of the boy. Standing, he shoved the papers back into his briefcase. &#x201c;Maybe you should think over our offer,&#x201d; he said with barely controlled anger. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t make offers like this very often. Shall we say that you&#x2019;re to make your decision by Christmas?&#x201d;<br> <br>As far as the man could tell, the boy showed no emotion. Cold little bugger, the man thought. Heart as frigid as a computer chip. Maybe he wasn&#x2019;t real at all but one of his own creations. Somehow, putting the boy down made him feel better about his own IQ, which was a &#x201c;mere&#x201d; 122.<br> <br>Quickly, he shook the boy&#x2019;s hand, and as he did so he realized that in another year the boy would be taller than he was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch,&#x201d; he said and left the room.<br> <br>Eli worked hard to control his inner shaking. Although he seemed so cool on the exterior, inside he was doing cartwheels. Princeton! he thought. Contact with real scientists! Talk with people who wanted to know more about life than the latest football scores!<br> <br>Slowly, he walked out the door, giving the man time to get away. Eli knew that the man hadn&#x2019;t liked him, but he was used to that. A long time ago Eli had learned to be very, very cautious with people. Since he was three he had known he was &#x201c;different&#x201d; from other kids. At five his mother had taken him to school to be tested, to see whether he fit into the redbirds or the bluebirds reading group. Busy with other students and parents, the teacher had told Eli to get a book from the shelf and read it to her. She had meant one of the many pretty picture books. Her intention had been to find out which children had been read to by their parents and which had grown up glued to a TV.<br> <br>Like all children, Eli had wanted to impress his teacher, so he&#x2019;d climbed on a chair and pulled down a college textbook titled Learning Disabilities that the teacher kept on a top shelf, then quietly went to stand beside her and began softly to read from page one. Since Eli was a naturally solitary child and his mother didn&#x2019;t push him to do what he didn&#x2019;t want to do, he had spent most of his life in near seclusion. He&#x2019;d had no idea that reading from a college textbook when he was a mere five years old was unusual. All he&#x2019;d wanted to do was to pass the reading test and get into the top reading group.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine, Eli,&#x201d; his mother said after he&#x2019;d read half a page. &#x201c;I think Miss Wilson is going to put you with the redbirds. Aren&#x2019;t you, Miss Wilson?&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though he was only five, Eli had recognized the wide-eyed look of horror on the teacher&#x2019;s face. Her expression had said, What do I do with this freak?<br> <br>Since his entry into school, Eli had learned about being &#x201c;different.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d learned about jealousy and being excluded and not fitting in with the other children. Only with his mother was he &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; His mother didn&#x2019;t think he was unusual or strange; he was just hers.<br> <br>Now, years later, when Eli left his meeting with the man from Princeton, he was still shaking, and when he saw Chelsea he gave her one of his rare smiles. When Eli was in the third grade, he&#x2019;d met Chelsea Hamilton, who was not as smart as he was, of course, but near enough that he could talk to her. In her way Chelsea was as much a freak as Eli was, for Chelsea was rich&#x2014;very, very rich&#x2014;and even by six she&#x2019;d found that people wanted to know her for what they could get from her rather than her personality. The children had been two oddities in the boring little classroom, and they&#x2019;d become eternal friends.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Chelsea demanded, bending her head to look into Eli&#x2019;s face. She was six months older than he, and she&#x2019;d always been taller. But now Eli was beginning to catch up to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing in this building?&#x201d; Eli asked. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t supposed to be here.&#x201d; Smugly, he was making her wait for his news.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re slipping, brain-o. My father owns this place.&#x201d; She tossed her long, golden, glossy hair. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s friends with the dean at Princeton. I&#x2019;ve known about the meeting for two weeks.&#x201d; At twelve, Chelsea was already on the way to being a beauty. Her problems in life were going to be the stuff of dreams: too tall, too thin, too smart, too rich. Their houses were only ten minutes apart, but in value, they were miles apart. Eli&#x2019;s house would fit into Chelsea&#x2019;s marble foyer.<br> <br>When Eli didn&#x2019;t respond, she looked straight ahead. &#x201c;Dad called last night and I cried so much at missing him that he&#x2019;s buying us a new CD-ROM. Maybe I&#x2019;ll let you see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eli smiled again. Chelsea hadn&#x2019;t realized that she&#x2019;d said &#x201c;us,&#x201d; meaning the two of them. She was great at the emotional blackmail of her parents, who spent most of their lives traveling around the world, leaving the family business to Chelsea&#x2019;s older siblings. A few tears of anguish and her parents gave her anything money could buy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Princeton wants me,&#x201d; Eli said as they emerged into the almost constant sunshine of Denver, its clean streets stretching before them. The autumn air was crisp and clear.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew it!&#x201d; she said, throwing her head back in exultation. &#x201c;When? For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m to go in the spring semester, just to get my feet wet, then a summer session. If my work is good enough, I can enter full-time next fall.&#x201d; For a moment he turned to look at her, and for just that second he let his guard down and Chelsea saw how very much he wanted this. Eli passionately hated the idea of high school, of having to sit through days of classes with a bunch of semiliterate louts who took great pride in their continuing ignorance. This program would give Eli the opportunity to skip all those grades and get on with something useful.<br> <br>&#x201c;That gives us the whole rest of the year to work,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Dad to buy us&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; Eli said.<br> <br>It took a moment for those words to register with Chelsea. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go to Princeton?&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Chelsea had never considered, if she wanted something&#x2014;whether to buy it or do it&#x2014;that she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to.<br> <br>When Eli looked at her, his face was full of anguish. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s going to take care of Mom?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br> <br>Chelsea opened her mouth to say that Eli had to think of himself first, but she closed it again. Eli&#x2019;s mom, Miranda, did need taking care of. She had the softest heart in the world, and if anyone had a problem, Miranda always had room to listen and love. Chelsea never liked to think that she needed anything as soppy as a mother, but there had been many times over the years when she&#x2019;d flung herself against the soft bosom of Eli&#x2019;s ever-welcoming mother.<br> <br>However, it was because of Miranda&#x2019;s sweetness that she needed looking after. His mother was like a lamb living in a world of hungry wolves. If it weren&#x2019;t for Eli&#x2019;s constant vigilance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, Chelsea didn&#x2019;t like to think what would have happened to his mother. Just look at the horrid man she&#x2019;d married. Eli&#x2019;s father was a gambler, a con artist, promiscuous, and a liar of epic proportions.<br> <br>&#x201c;When do you have to give them your answer?&#x201d; Chelsea asked softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;My birthday,&#x201d; Eli answered. It was one of his little vanities that he always referred to Christmas as his birthday. Eli&#x2019;s mom said that he was her Christmas gift from God, so she was never going to cheat Eli because she&#x2019;d been lucky enough to have him on Christmas Day. So every Christmas, Eli had a pile of gifts under a tree and another pile on a table with a big, gaudy birthday cake, a cake that had no hint of anything to do with Christmas.<br> <br>In silence, the two of them locked their bikes, then walked down Denver&#x2019;s downtown streets, forgoing the trolley that ran through the middle of town. Chelsea knew that Eli needed to think, and he did that best by walking or riding his bike. She knew without asking that Eli would never abandon his mother. If it came to a choice between Princeton and taking care of his mother, Eli would choose the person he loved best. For all that Eli managed to appear cool and calculating, Chelsea knew that when it came to the two people he loved the most&#x2014;her and his mother&#x2014;inside, Eli was marshmallow cream.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Chelsea said brightly, &#x201c;maybe you&#x2019;re overreacting. Maybe your mother can get along without you.&#x201d; Without us, she almost said. &#x201c;Who took care of her before you were born?&#x201d;<br> <br>Eli gave her a sideways look. &#x201c;No one, and look what happened to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father happened,&#x201d; Chelsea said heavily. She hesitated as she thought about the matter. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been divorced for two years now. Maybe your mother will remarry and her new husband will take care of her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who will she marry? The last man she went out with ended up &#x2018;forgetting&#x2019; his wallet, so Mom paid for dinner and a tank full of gas. A week later I found out he was married.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unfortunately, Miranda&#x2019;s generosity didn&#x2019;t just extend to children but to every living creature. Eli said that if it were left up to his mother, there would be no need for a city animal shelter because all the unwanted animals in Denver would live with them. For a moment, Chelsea had an image of sweet Miranda surrounded by wounded animals and uneducated men asking her for money. For Chelsea, &#x201c;uneducated men&#x201d; was the worst image she could conjure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe if you tell her about the offer, she&#x2019;ll come up with a solution,&#x201d; Chelsea said helpfully.<br> <br>Eli&#x2019;s face became fierce. &#x201c;My mother would sacrifice her life for me. If she knew about this offer, she&#x2019;d personally escort me to Princeton. My mother cares only about me and never about herself. My mother&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Chelsea rolled her eyes skyward. In every other aspect of life Eli had the most purely scientific brain she&#x2019;d ever encountered, but when it came to his mother, there was no reasoning with him. Chelsea also thought Miranda was a lovely woman, but she wasn&#x2019;t exactly ready for sainthood. For one thing, she was thoroughly undisciplined. She ate too much, read too many books that did not improve one&#x2019;s mind, and wasted too much time on frivolous things, like making Eli and Chelsea Halloween costumes. Of course, neither of them ever told her that they thought Halloween was a juvenile holiday. Instead of tramping the streets asking for candy, they would go to Chelsea&#x2019;s house and work on their computers while dripping artificial blood. They sent the butler out to purchase candy that they&#x2019;d later show to Eli&#x2019;s mom so she&#x2019;d think they were &#x201c;normal&#x201d; kids.<br> <br>Only once had Chelsea dared tell Eli that she thought it was a bit absurd for them to sit at their computers wearing uncomfortable and grotesque costumes while calculating logarithms. Eli had said, &#x201c;My mother made these for us to wear,&#x201d; and that had been the final decree. The matter was never mentioned again.<br> <br><br> <br>As Eli rode his bike onto the cracked, weedy concrete drive of his mother&#x2019;s house, he caught a glimpse of the taillights of his father&#x2019;s car as it scurried out of sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Deadbeat!&#x201d; Eli said under his breath, knowing that his father must have been watching for him so he could run away as soon as he saw his son.<br> <br>Every time Eli thought of the word father his stomach clenched. Leslie Harcourt had never been a father to him, nor a husband to his wife, Miranda. The man had spent his life trying to make his family believe he was &#x201c;important.&#x201d; Too important to talk to his family; too important to go anywhere with his wife and child; too important to give them any time or attention.<br> <br>According to Leslie Harcourt, other people were the ones who really counted in life. &#x201c;My friends need me,&#x201d; Eli had heard his father say over and over. His mother would say, &#x201c;But Leslie, I need you too. Eli needs school clothes and there are no groceries in the house and my car has been broken for three weeks. We need food and we need clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eli would watch as his father got that look on his face, as though he were being enormously patient with someone who couldn&#x2019;t understand the simplest concepts. &#x201c;My friend has broken up with his girlfriend and he has to have someone to talk to and I&#x2019;m the only one. Miranda, he&#x2019;s in pain. Don&#x2019;t you understand? Pain! I must go to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eli had heard his father say this same sort of thing a thousand times. Sometimes his mother would show a little spunk and say, &#x201c;Maybe if your friends cried on the shoulders of their girlfriends, they wouldn&#x2019;t be breaking up.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Leslie Harcourt never listened to anyone except himself&#x2014;and he was a master at figuring out how to manipulate other people so he could get as much out of them as possible. Leslie knew that his wife, Miranda, was softhearted; it was the reason he&#x2019;d married her. She forgave anyone anything, and all Leslie had to do was say &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; every month or so and Miranda forgave him whatever.<br> <br>And in return for those few words, Miranda gave Leslie security. She gave him a home that he contributed little or no money to and next to no time; he had no responsibilities either to her or to his son. Most important, she provided him with an excuse to give to all his women as to why he couldn&#x2019;t marry them. He invariably ...</p><h2>Victorian Internet</h2><p>Beginning with the Abbe Nollet&#39;s famous experiment of 1746, when he successfully demonstrated that electricity could pass from one end to the other of a chain of two hundred monks, Tom Standage tells the story of the spread of the telegraph and its transformation of the Victorian world. The telegraph was greeted by all the same concerns, hype, social panic and excitement that now surround the Internet, and Standage provides both a fascinating insight into the past and a context in which to think rather differently of today&#39;s concerns. Standage has a wonderful prose style and an excellent eye for the telling and engaging story. Popular history at its best.</p><p>Tom Standage is science correspondent at the ECONOMIST. He is married and lives in Greenwich.</p><h2>Civilization and Its Discontents</h2><p>Reprint of the 1930 American edition. In this seminal book, Sigmund Freud enumerates the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual. The primary friction stems from the individual&#39;s quest for instinctual freedom and civilization&#39;s contrary demand for conformity and instinctual repression. Many of humankind&#39;s primitive instincts (for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification) are clearly harmful to the well-being of a human community. As a result, civilization creates laws that prohibit killing, rape, and adultery, and it implements severe punishments if such commandments are broken. This process, argues Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that instills perpetual feelings of discontent in its citizens.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Putting</h2><p><i>The Art of Putting</i>, first published in 1920, was the 'how to' book of its time.

Besides being the champion golfer of his time, he took the game of golf to the world in a number of ways. He participated in challenge matches and demonstrations in Britain, Western Europe and North America, and designed, made and sold both clubs and balls in the main cities of Britain and North America.

A person who watches birds? I suspect that most people watch birds, and yet many do not consider themselves bird watchers.<br><br>The definition of a bird watcher is changing. Thirty years ago, the "typical" bird watcher was exemplified by magazine cartoons as a nattily dressed, elderly person who, from all outward appearances, was eccentric, if not downright odd. That early image of "the little old lady in tennis shoes" gave the sport a stigma which, to this day, makes some people uneasy about admitting that they enjoy watching birds.<br><br>Today, the typical bird watcher, or "birder" as we call ourselves, is male, white, married, above average in education and income, and is either retired or a young professional according to one recent study. This may be the <i>average</i> bird watcher, but the sport attracts all kinds of people from all walks of life, and their numbers are growing at a dramatic rate.<br><br>During a recent telephone conversation with Roger Tory Peterson, the dean of bird watching the world over, I asked him to estimate the number of bird watchers in the United States today. "What is your definition of a bird watcher?" he responded. Before I could answer his first question, he went on, "Do you include duck hunters as bird watchers?" We finally settled on the figure of at least twenty million Americans who spend money on bird seed or equipment, or on travel just to see birds.<br><br>I believe this is a conservative estimate. A recent study conducted by Richard M. DeGraaf and Brian R. Payne of the U.S. Forest Service Research Unit at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst showed that Americans spend at least $500 million a year to enjoy birds. Of this total, $170 million was spent for bird seed; $187 million for photographic equipment and processing; $115 million for binoculars; $15 million for birdhouses and feeders; and $4 million for bird guides and other books. These figures do not include travel expenditures. Another survey showed that bird watchers and photographers alone accounted for 9,900,600 use-days on National Forest lands in a single year.<br><br>So, bird watching may have been the sport of "little old ladies in tennis shoes" at one time, but "you've come a long way, baby" since those days. Bird watching is probably a billion-dollar-a-year industry and may be the fastest growing family sport in America.<br><br>Why is it so popular and why is it growing so fast? The answer is simple: The sport of bird watching is easy to get into, inexpensive to maintain, requires little prior knowledge and almost no equipment. Actually, all you need to attract birds to your backyard is a little seed thrown on the ground...then wait for the birds in your neighborhood to find it. But if you really want to attract a variety of interesting and colorful birds on a permanent or at least seasonal basis, there are proven ways of doing it, and that's what this book is all about.<br><br><b>LEARN TO IDENTIFY THE BIRDS</b><br><br>Wild birds are everywhere during all seasons, in all habitats. Bird watchers start out by observing the birds they see in their backyards, on their way to work, around their camping areas, etc. Though you certainly don't have to be an expert to enjoy birding, it helps to be able to identify what you see. By being able to recognize the species, you are more likely to learn something about its characteristics and habits.<br><br>We identify birds by spotting certain key field marks, behavior, song, size or shape. Thanks to Roger Tory Peterson, who in 1934 wrote and illustrated his first <i>A Field Guide to the Birds,</i> we know that every species has its own particular identification signs or marks. Before the Peterson <i>Field Guide,</i> bird watching wasn't as much fun. The descriptions of birds were made by scientists who worked largely from study skins in museums. Instead of saying that a robin was a gray-backed bird with a rusty breast, they described it in the minutest detail, including the "white spots around the eye and the streaked throat." Peterson's new system changed the whole concept of bird watching by giving us a simple and exact method of quick field identifications.<br><br>During my courtship with my wife, Kit, I taught her how to identify birds. Her experience should give encouragement to anyone starting from zero. Within one year, Kit learned to identify over 100 species from sight and sound. The way she did it was to look at each bird she encountered, often through binoculars, listen to it sing or chip, and then check the illustration of that bird in a field guide and read the description of it. I pointed out to her the salient field marks...white wing bars, red cap, white outer tail feathers, smaller than a robin, larger than a crow. I would impress upon her the habitat in which it was found, how it was acting, the song or alarm note it gave, and the season of the year in which we found it. She is a quick learner, and within three years she was able to identify 300 to 400 birds and was sometimes correcting my errors in identification. Her pinnacle came two years ago when she and Roger Tory Peterson had a serious discussion comparing the differences between a newly hatched coot chick and a newly hatched chick of the European moorhen.<br><br>More recently, Kit and I were amazed to find a birder making accurate field identifications without binoculars. We were in Cuba, birding with that country's foremost ornithologist, Orlando Garrido. While most of us were looking for the field marks through binoculars, Garrido was watching for characteristic movements such as tail bobbing, wing flitting, nervousness, head movement, stance, movement in flights. I tried to catch him in error, but he was always correct and more rapid than I in identifying the bird. He is the most extraordinary field ornithologist I have known.<br><br><b>THE GAMES BACKYARD BIRD WATCHERS PLAY</b><br><br>No matter how you look at it, bird watching is a sport. It is a personal challenge to identify the birds you see, learn their habits and how they differ from other species.<br><br>The most common game that bird watchers play is the "listing game." Almost all birders, particularly backyard birders, keep records of the species they see in their neighborhood. Kit and I have recorded 142 species in five years seen through our windows and from our property. Using the official checklist published by the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology, we record, each year, the date on which we see the first bird of each species. This gives us a running record of when the first red-winged blackbird appears each spring, the first junco each fall. The dates vary year to year by as much as two weeks, depending on weather conditions. We also note the date each spring when the ice goes out of our lake, which has a direct effect on the waterfowl we see. We mark the date that the lake freezes over each winter as well.<br><br>One of the highlights of our listing game is the appearance of our loon each spring. I theorize that any lake that can support a loon, even if for only a few days, is a wild lake. Our lake is located only twenty-six miles northwest of a major metropolitan area. Each spring, our loon spends at least a week with us soon after the ice disappears, and by his appearance declares that our little lake is "wild" for another year. I suspect that there are probably several loons that visit our lake, but we can't differentiate because they all look alike. We did have two at one time several springs ago. Last fall we had a loon headed south in its winter plumage, which was decidedly different from its spring garb. Notes like these are all part of our list.<br><br>There are several other kinds of lists, such as the one-day list, which is a record of all the birds seen or heard on a specific day. Some like to keep a trip list or a list of birds seen during a visit to another backyard bird watcher's home. But the most common list is the one that records all those birds seen or heard over a particular year or each of a series of years, like the one we keep.<br><br>One backyard birder not only keeps a running list of the birds in her yard but tries to photograph each one as well. She pastes a photographic print on the page of her record book opposite the dates and notes about that particular species. Another backyard birder posts all his records on a large wall chart that is a permanent part of that house's decor. People visiting him can see at a glance the birds he has seen and the dates the sightings were made. It's a great conversation piece.<br><br>The most dedicated keep a life list -- all those species seen during a lifetime, not just in the backyard, but for North America or for the world. The most radical of those life listers will go to any length to add just one more species to their list. A classic example is the North American champion, Dr. Joseph Taylor of New York. Dr. Taylor had 720 species on his life list when the Ross's gull was sighted in Massachusetts. Dr. Taylor was in Nairobi at the time. Not wanting to miss a rare opportunity to add that species to his North American list, Dr. Taylor flew from Nairobi to Massachusetts, saw the gull and then returned to his African tour. At this writing, Dr. Taylor still leads the life listers with more than 730 North American species.<br><br><b>TELEPHONE LINE FOR BIRDERS</b><br><br>To help listers see more birds, some larger cities have a "birding hot line." It is a telephone number a birder calls to get a taped recording of the current unusual species being seen in the area. The system also enables the caller to give information on an interesting sighting to be added to the tape.<br><br><b>HELP THE CHRISTMAS BIRD COUNT</b><br><br>Each holiday season, during the two weeks centering around Christmas, the National Audubon Society holds its annual Christmas Bird Counts throughout the world. More than 1,200 approved groups of bird watchers count the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals of each species in a fifteen-mile diameter over one twenty-four-hour period during those two weeks. In the U.S., the current record is 216 species, counted in Freeport, Texas. The record for the world was set in the Canal Zone of Panama, where 344 were recorded.<br><br>If there is a Christmas bird count in your area and if your backyard falls within the fifteen-mile diameter, offer to help the group by reporting all the species you see on that day in your yard. It is possible that some of the birds you see will not be found anywhere else in the counting area.<br><br>Reports on all the Christmas Bird Counts are printed in the National Audubon Society's publication, <i>American Birds.</i><br><br><b>SOME PLAY THE LISTENING GAME</b><br><br>Another game bird watchers play is the "listening" game. The challenge is to be able to identify as many species as possible by the songs or call notes they give. There has always been some disagreement among birders as to the validity of a record of a species that is heard but not seen. Personally, I believe that if you hear the bird and are positive of its song, then you are entitled to record it on your own personal list. However, the American Birding Association, the organization that keeps records of the top U.S. life listers, requires that the bird be seen before it can be officially recorded on a life list. Regardless, the ability to identify a species by its song or alarm note is a great accomplishment. No two species make identical sounds except imitators such as the mockingbird and starling. Once you learn the song of a species, identification is much easier and you don't have to spend time searching out the bird among heavy foliage or at the top of a high conifer.<br><br>Warblers are particularly hard to see. When Kit and I are birding in one of our favorite haunts, Mount Desert Island, Maine, the listening game is the only way to go. Blackburnian and bay-breasted warblers are nearly impossible to see in tall spruce trees, but their lovely songs are easy to recognize. If we had to spot each singing male to be sure of its identification, it would take all the fun out of birding in Maine. So the listening game is important and fun to play as you become more adept as a bird watcher.<br><br>Some backyard bird watchers record bird songs on tapes, then play them back to get interesting responses, particularly from male birds defending territories in spring and summer.<br><br><b>THE SCIENCE OF BIRD BANDING</b><br><br>A much more specialized game is that of banding birds. In fact, those who band (the British say "ring") don't consider it a game at all, but a serious and scientific effort to learn more about bird movements. Records of bandings and recoveries are kept at the Migratory Bird Research Laboratory, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Station, Laurel, Maryland 20811. (See page 230 for what to do when you find a banded bird.)<br><br><b>BREEDING BIRD RECORDS</b><br><br>Another valuable scientific effort is the North American Nest Record Card Program of the Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell University. Volunteers from all over North America record information about birds' nests they find and send a completed record card to the Cornell Laboratory, where it is fed into computer banks on each species. This information leads to valuable data about population trends and the effects of weather and environmental pollution on certain indicator species. For more information, write The North American Nest Card Program, 150 Sapsucker Woods Road, Ithaca, New York 14853.<br><br><b>THE FLOCKING OF BIRD WATCHERS</b><br><br>The sport of bird watching often leads to social gatherings. When two backyard bird watchers get together for dinner, cocktails, birthdays, other social events or even business meetings, the conversation inevitably turns to birds. An example of this is our relationship with our good friends, the Tom Rosts, who live in the community of Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Tom is a distinguished wildlife artist, and just outside his studio window is a very active bird feeding station. We see the Rosts about once a month, and a great deal of our visiting time is filled with conversation about the new birds we have seen at each of our homes since our last get-together. Our experience with the Rosts is probably typical of many birders.<br><br>Other birding friends join bird clubs to enjoy a more involved kind of ornithological socializing. Foremost among the bird clubs are the local chapters of the National Audubon Society. Most states also have ornithological societies and some have statewide or regional bird clubs as well. (See page 273 for names and addresses of organizations of interest to birders.)<br><br>The American Birding Association and the Bird Populations Institute are national associations to which many birders belong. More scientifically oriented birders and professional ornithologists join the American Ornithologists' Union, the Wilson Ornithological Society, the Cooper Ornithological Society or the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. The first of these groups, the AOU, concerns itself with, among other endeavors, the taxonomic aspects of ornithology and maintains the official list of both common and scientific names for birds of North America. The AOU has become better known recently for the numerous changes it has made in bird names. For example, there is no longer a Baltimore oriole. It was lumped with the Bullock's oriole and both are now called the northern oriole. The same is true of the myrtle and Audubon warblers. They are now called the yellow-rumped warbler. The AOU made three changes in the name of our common egret, from <i>American to common to great,</i> in the last decade. These changes and many others are based on well-founded scientific study, but some bird watchers get upset, mostly for sentimental...</p><h2>Babar Learns to Cook (Picturebacks)</h2><p>Illus. in full color by the author.

In an Oprahfied age people will tell strangers about their abortions or alcoholism, even declare on national television that they are dying of AIDS, yet just let a man suggest to his sleepless, perspiring, weepy wife that her uncharacteristic moods and symptoms might have something to do with menopause and he's bound to get a blanket denial: "What are you talking about! I'm too young!"</p><p>Menopause may be the last taboo. The first friend to whom I ever mentioned the subject was a sultry-looking woman of fifty. She had always prided herself on her appearance and gained much of her status from creatively supporting her husband, a successful author who looks somewhat younger than she. I asked if she had ever talked with anyone about menopause.</p><p>"No. And I don't want to."</p><p>"Women don't bring up the subject around you?"</p><p>"One friend did," she said sourly. "I haven't seen her since."</p><p>Another friend, a public television producer whose natural temperament is appallingly calm, recalled with rueful laughter her first sign of the Change of Life. She was seated between two titans of industry at a high-protocol Park Avenue dinner party, the kind where the place cards look like tracings from the <i>Book of Kells</i> and she was feeling particularly confident and pretty in her new black designer suit with its flattering white satin collar, when out of the blue a droplet of something hit her collar. Then another drop. What the -- was the help dribbling wine? Could there be a leaky ceiling under all that gorgeous boiserie? Suddenly she noticed her husband's gaze turn to alarm from across the table: What horrible thing was happening to her? She put a hand to her face. Her forehead was wet as a swamp.</p><p><i>Oh no,</i> said her eyes, <i>not me!</i> as the moisture began running in rivulets down her face and slipping off her chin -- plop -- onto her pearly satin collar. <i>Should I pick up the white linen napkin and wipe my forehead?</i> She reached for the five-hundred-threads-per-inch napery, hesitated -- <i>no, all the makeup will come off on the damn napkin</i> -- when a few more plops fell into her decolletage. Frantic, she began dabbing at her face. Trying to pretend it wasn't happening, she turned to her dinner partner and began smiling and mopping, chatting and fanning, laughing at his jokes and dabbing, trying to keep up her end of the conversation while she wanted nothing more in this world than to disappear into the kitchen and tear off her clothes and open the freezer door -- never mind that it was February -- and just <i>stand there.</i></p><p>She and her husband have since had the Thermostat Wars usual in menopausal households -- "It's freezing in here!" "No, it's boiling." "Did you turn the thermostat below fifty again?" "Oh, why don't you just get flannel pajamas!" But the producer is one of the lucky ones: She has had no other indicators beyond hot flashes that she is passing into another stage of life.</p><p>It happens to every woman. Pregnancy we can choose to go through or not. With menopause there is no choice. It happens to teachers and discount store clerks and dental hygienists, who nonetheless have to function in public, on their feet, every day. It happens to Navy pilots and gray-haired graduate students and former Olympic athletes, who are accustomed to demanding the highest physical and mental performance from themselves. It happens to women of color, to women in the home, it happens even in Hollywood. Gorgeous Goldie, Whoopi Goldberg, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Jessica Lange, and Candy Bergen, too, must deal with menopause. These women are hardly over the hill. In fact, they are more potent than ever.</p><p>But they never mention the big M.</p><p>The central myth is that menopause is a time in a woman's life when she goes batty for a few years -- subject to wild rages and deep depressions -- and after it she mourns her lost youth and fades into the woodwork. In truth, menopause is a bridge to the most vital and liberated period in a woman's life.</p><p>Certainly hormones have a powerful effect on our physical life and our mood, just as hormones underlie male aggression and affect potency as men age. During the passage through menopause, when hormones are spiking and falling a few times every day, or possibly within an hour, many women do experience waves of fatigue and bouts of the blues. But that is very different from clinical depression. And most important, it is temporary.</p><p>In fact, women in their fifties, once through menopause, have the lowest rates of clinical depression compared to women at any other stage of life. Depression actually subsides with age for women.</p><p>Ironically, the people who are the most evasive and unsympathetic about menopause tend to be women in their forties. Slouching toward the bridge to that unknown and frightening new territory of "postmenopausal woman," they may become "menophobic." Their own resistance to identifying with the stage of life beyond reproductivity is sometimes expressed in an uncharacteristic intolerance of their own friends.</p><p>A thirty-nine-year-old Chicago woman moved to a new city the year her premature menopause came on. Although she made new friends quickly, they began to shun her as soon as she mentioned physical signs associated with the Change. The ostracized woman struggled through five years with a large fibroid cyst and digestive problems before her friends and doctors acknowledged the source of her difficulties.</p><p>"I clearly remember not being sympathetic," recalled one of her friends with considerable regret. Others of the woman's friends remembered their impatience. "We'd talk about her among ourselves: 'She's complaining about hot flashes and stomach problems again this week. Why doesn't she just get over it?' We never really said, 'She's suffering.' We certainly never mentioned the possibility of menopause. And here we are, <i>women."</i></p><p>"Women can be the worst," acknowledged her best friend.</p><p>The formerly shunned woman now realizes, "People wouldn't relate my problems to menopause because that would automatically classify them as old." Menopause must be one of the most misunderstood passages in a woman's life. One study showed that two-thirds of all American women say nothing to anybody as they approach what may be a distressing and even fearsome Change. But who can blame us? Menopause is inextricably linked with middle age, and in the youth-oriented societies of North America and Europe even the mention of middle age has a stigma about it. Shame, fear, and misinformation are the vague demons that have kept us silent about a passage that could not be more universal among females. The most common fears are: <i>I'll lose my looks, I'II lose in my sex appeal, I'll get depressed, I'll become invisible.</i> We don't have to lose any of these things. Yet the obvious sources of information and comfort -- mothers, doctors, academics -- have shied away from the subject. All that is changing as the subject of menopause becomes part of our public conversation.</p><p>Today fifty is the apex of the female life cycle. And menopause is more properly seen as the gateway to a Second Adulthood, a series of stages never before part of the predictable life cycle for other than the very long-lived.</p><p>If forty-five is the old age of youth, fifty is the youth of a woman's Second Adulthood. In fact, we can anticipate at least as many years of life after menopause as we have already lived as reproductive women. You don't believe it? Consider. Most women begin menstruating around thirteen and begin stopping at around forty-eight -- remaining defined, and confined, to some degree by their procreative abilities for thirty-five years. The life expectancy of an average woman who lives to age fifty in the U.S. or U.K. is now eighty-one. (A man of fifty can expect to live until seventy-six.) So, from the time she reaches perimenopause, the average woman has thirty-three more years.</p><p>The projected life span of the current generation of women now hitting fifty in the U.S. is beyond anything known by the human species. They can expect to live routinely into their eighties and nineties. Here is the most stunning statistic, affirmed by Kenneth Manton, research professor of demographic studies at Duke University.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>A healthy, fifty-year-old American woman who does not succumb to heart disease or cancer can expect to see her</i> ninety-second birthday.</blockquote><p>Whoever prepared us for the possibility that we might live long enough to forget the name of our first husband?</p><p>Since there has been virtually no period in the history of the human species when evolution has favored postmenopausal females, we shall <i>have to</i> favor ourselves. We shall have to intervene -- medically, hormonally, psychologically, spiritually -- because we cannot assume that aging will go smoothly. Evolution didn't provide for it.</p><p>The main point is that we are living longer lives than ever before. But my impression from talking to thousands of women all over America and Europe is that this new perspective -- only milliseconds old in evolutionary terms -- has not caught up with most people.</p><p>Women today often believe they are well-informed about menopause. But the majority of women regard menopause as a short-term event and do not connect it with long-term health problems in postmenopausal life, such as heart disease, osteoporosis, or cancer. Less than half the women in a recent Gallup survey related the Change to these important issues, and more than one in four did not see a doctor at all, because they felt their symptoms were a natural part of menopause.</p><p>A keen social observer, British novelist Fay Weldon, points to the psychology of these women: "They'd on the whole rather not know -- for if we don't know, it doesn't matter." But it does matter. It matters whether or not a woman in her sixties finds it painful to walk or even bend as a result of osteoporosis. It matters when a woman in her fifties has a heart attack. It matters that women look these possibilitie...</p></p><h2>Mythology Of The American Nations: An Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Gods, Heroes, Spirits, Sacred Places, Rituals And Ancient Beliefs Of The North ...

Until now. </p><p>With the publication of <i>Sinatra in Hollywood,</i> an analytical yet deeply personal look at the screen legend of Frank Sinatra, Sinatra&#x2019;s standing as a significant, indeed legendary, screen actor has now been placed in full perspective. Examining each of Sinatra&#x2019;s seventy film appearances in depth, Tom Santopietro traces the arc of his astonishing six-decade run as a film actor, from his rise to stardom in &#x201c;boy next door&#x201d; musical films like <i>Anchors Aweigh </i>and <i>On the Town</i><i>,</i> through his fall from grace with legendary flops like <i>The Kissing Bandit, </i>to the near-mythic comeback with his Oscar-winning performance in <i>From Here to Eternity.</i></p><p>Laced throughout with Sinatra&#x2019;s own observations on his film work, <i>Sinatra in Hollywood</i> deals head-on with his tumultuous marriages to Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and directly addresses the rumors of Mob involvement in Sinatra&#x2019;s Hollywood career. Ranging from the specifics of his controversial acting nickname of One Take Charlie to the iconic Rat Pack film <i>Ocean&#x2019;s Eleven</i><i>,</i> from the groundbreaking performance in <i>The Manchurian Candidate </i>to the moving and elegiac late-career roles as tough yet vulnerable detectives, the myths and personal foibles are stripped away, placing the focus squarely on the work. </p><p>Oftentimes brilliant, occasionally off-kilter, but always compelling, Frank Sinatra, the film icon who registered as nothing less than emblematic of &#x201c;The American Century,&#x201d; here receives his full due as the serious artist he was, the actor about whom director Billy Wilder emphatically stated, &#x201c;Frank Sinatra is beyond talent.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Tom Santopietro has worked for the past twenty years in New York theater as a manager of more than two dozen Broadway shows, including <i>A Few Good Men, The</i> <i>Tale of the Allergist&#x2019;s Wife,</i> <i>A Doll&#x2019;s House,</i> <i>Master Class,</i> <i>Tru,</i> <i>The Iceman Cometh,</i> and <i>Noises Off</i>.

As the applause turns into cheers, he kisses both of his dates for the glittering occasion--daughter Nancy, thirteen, and son Frank, ten--and bounds up the aisle to excitedly accept his award. Taking the stage and grasping the golden statue, Frank Sinatra pronounces himself "deeply thrilled and very moved." Briefly cracking wise--"And I'd just like to say, however, that they're doing a lot of songs here tonight, but nobody asked me"--Frank professes his love for the crowd, expresses his thanks, and strides offstage, where, Oscar clasped firmly in hand, he runs the gauntlet of photographers. Flashbulbs pop and hundreds of photos are snapped. Frank Sinatra is back on top of the show business world.Never mind the two studios that had dropped Frank's contract, the back-to-back flops of <i>Double Dynamite</i> and <i>Meet Danny Wilson,</i> and the three years spent in the wilderness of turned backs and unreturned phone calls. Tonight's a new night--and in that marvelously phony "Hooray for Hollywood" fashion always at its white hottest on Oscar night, everyone wants to congratulate Frank. Everyone wants a piece of the comeback <i>Variety</i> almost instantly termed "the greatest comeback in theatre history." And after backs are slapped, hands shaken, and hugs exchanged, Frank Sinatra, Mr. "Center-of-the-Action," does something quintessentially Sinatra--he walks out. Leaves all the festivities, the glittery Governors Ball, where everyone in Hollywood could pay homage, and walks the streets of Beverly Hills. Alone. As if no one else could understand the true distance of his journey.Reflecting on the night years later, Frank mused, "I couldn't even share it with another human being. I ducked the party, lost the crowds, and took a walk. Just me and Oscar. I think I relived my entire life as I walked up and down the streets of Beverly Hills." In an entire adult lifetime spent onstage and now onscreen, through all the cheering crowds and boozy camaraderie with friends, Frank Sinatra never could outrun the loneliness that had haunted him since his solitary childhood. Loving parents? Yes. Parents who were always there? Most decidedly not. And as Frank grew up, and the desire--no, need--to perform grew, the reverent attention of the crowds provided consolation for his lonely nature. The years rolled on, and stardom arrived, but records and public performances no longer sufficed; Frank Sinatra had made a willful decision that the worldwide fame and immortality afforded by Hollywood movies would be the ticket, and tonight, Oscar night, he had proved it to every last person in America.Through sheer force of talent and willpower, Frank Sinatra had fulfilled his dream of movie stardom, won Hollywood's top honor, and reminded everyone in filmland--hell, everyone in the world--that he had officially arrived as a top-flight dramatic actor. This was no mere singing-and-dancing routine alongside Gene Kelly. This was powerful dramatic work--"a whole new kind of thing," as he said in his acceptance speech--and there'd be plenty more of it to follow if Frank had anything to say about it. And he did.Rattling off no fewer than seventeen major motion pictures in the next sixyears alone, Frank Sinatra served notice over and over again that he was a very big and important film actor. A movie star. One of the immortals.But nothing was ever simple with Frank Sinatra, especially when it came to Hollywood. In his own words: "I made some pretty good pictures ... and I tried a few things that turned out to be mistakes ... ."Right on both counts.SINATRA IN HOLLYWOOD. Copyright ï¿½ 2008 by Tom Santopietro.

Reprint.</p><p>Jonathan Gash is the author of twenty Lovejoy mysteries and of <i>Different Women Dancing</i> and <i>Prey Dancing</i>, from his new Dr. Clare Burtonall series. He lives in Colchester, England.In his 17th appearance ( Paid and Loving Eyes was #16), East Anglia's sexy antiques expert, Lovejoy, steps onto a charity auction block as Slave for a Day. The winning bid--"two thousand guineas, an unbelievable sum"--by an elegant lady wearing pale blue prompts sympathy from his friends. Why? Once again Lovejoy is center stage in a baffling, nefarious scheme, this one hatched by a bunch of greedy rich people. He's off to Mynydd Mal, Wales, driving one of four horse-drawn caravans housing mental patients. Numbered among these are Phillida, pickpocket, shoplifter and mother of baby Arthur (whose diapers Lovejoy frequently changes); Corinda, who's forever taking her clothes off; and shy Boris, who may be having an affair with a royal princess. Members of the syndicate pop up from time to time. Lovejoy enjoys his usual success with the ladies but has less luck figuring out the scam, nearly getting himself blown to bits before nailing it down. This caper requires concentration from readers who must interpret the often obscure lingo and keep straight an unwieldy cast littered with unnecessary and forgettable characters. But even when difficult, Gash delivers more than a fair share of antiques lore, finely timed comedy and, in this case, a dazzling climax. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In My Dark Dreams</h2><p>Mint condition hardcover book,hardcover book, no marks, no wear to book or jacket.</p><p></p><h2>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Hpc Philosophical Classics Ser.)</h2><p>In the posthumously published &#34;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&#34;, the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume attacked many of the traditional arguments for the existence of God, expressing the belief that religion is founded on ignorance and irrational fears. Though calm and courteous in tone - at times even tactfully ambiguous - the conversations between Hume&#39;s vividly realized fictional figures form perhaps the most searching case ever mounted against orthodox Christian theological thinking and the &#39;deism&#39; of the time, which pointed to the wonders of creation as conclusive evidence of God&#39;s Design. Hume&#39;s characters debate these issues with extraordinary passion, lucidity and humor, in one of the most compelling philosophical works ever written.</p><p>David Hume (1711 &#x2013;1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, known especially for his philosophical empiricism and skepticism. He is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment. Hume is often grouped with John Locke, George Berkeley, and a handful of others as a British Empiricist. Beginning with his A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic "science of man" that examined the psychological basis of human nature. In stark opposition to the rationalists who preceded him, most notably Descartes, he concluded that desire rather than reason governed human behavior, saying famously: "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions." A prominent figure in the skeptical philosophical tradition and a strong empiricist, he argued against the existence of innate ideas, concluding instead that humans have knowledge only of things they directly experience. He developed the position that mental behavior is governed by "custom"; our use of induction, for example, is justified only by our idea of the "constant conjunction" of causes and effects. Without direct impressions of a metaphysical "self," he concluded that humans have no actual conception of the self, only of a bundle of sensations associated with the self. Hume advocated a compatibilist theory of free will that proved extremely influential on subsequent moral philosophy. Hume also examined the normative is&#x2013;ought problem. He held notoriously ambiguous views of Christianity, but famously challenged the argument from design in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779). Kant credited Hume with waking him up from his "dogmatic slumbers" and Hume has proved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on utilitarianism, logical positivism, William James, philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The philosopher Jerry Fodor proclaimed Hume's Treatise "the founding document of cognitive science." Also famous as a prose stylist, Hume pioneered the essay as a literary genre and engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and political philosophy), James Boswell, Joseph Butler, and Thomas Reid.</p><h2>God and the Universe of Faiths</h2><p>This accessible text tackles the major issues challenging contemporary Christian belief to produce a controversial conception both of Christianity and of the wider religious life of humanity.</p><p>John Hick, winner of the 1991 Grawemeyer Award for significant new thinking in religion during the past five years, is a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Humanities at Birmingham University, U.K., and Danforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion, emeritus, at the Claremont Graduate School, California.

Also included are about a dozen larger-scale projects for decks and assorted outbuildings. Each entry provides a list of materials, photos and construction drawings, and a detailed procedural narrative. An introductory chapter, purporting to survey outdoor building techniques, is too cursory to be of any help. In its discussion of materials, for example, it fails even to mention pressure-treated lumber. Like too many project books, this is neither original nor particularly imaginative and fails to offer any more than the sum of its parts.

The mid-to-late 1930s saw some of the most innovative designs in motorcycling, and some of the best machines come from the post-Depression period. But they were also more expensive. The role of the motorcycle as inexpensive public transportation devolved through the 30s: it became more of a hobbyist or competition machine. Use in police and armed forces also grew, providing a stable market for more utilitarian machines - especially as Europe rearmed. But motorcycling was increasingly an enthusiast&#39;s hobby. The Second World War again brought a closure to many factories. A lot of firms went on to make products for the war effort, some simply closed. Only a handful continued to make motorcycles, mostly to supply the British Army. Export sales dwindled as shipping was strangled by U boat raids. German bombing raids in Coventry and London spelled disaster for some companies: they never recovered from the loss of plants and equipment. Others simply never returned to make motorcycles.

The Perilous West tells this riveting story in depth for the first time, focusing on each of the seven explorers in turn &#x2013; Ramsay Crooks, Robert McClellan, John Hoback, Jacob Reznor, Edward Robinson, Pierre Dorion, and Marie Dorion. These seven counted the Tetons, Hells Canyon, and South Pass among their discoveries. More importantly, they forged the Oregon Trail&#x2013;a path destined to link the Atlantic coast with the Pacific, spurring national expansion as it carried trappers, soldiers, pioneers, missionaries, and gold-seekers westward. The PerilousWest begins in 1806, when Crooks and McClellan meet Lewis and Clark, and the vast expanse from the Dakotas to the Pacific coast appears a commercial paradise. The story ends in 1814, when a band of French Canadian trappers rescue Marie Dorion, and even John Jacob Astor&#x2019;s well-financed enterprise has ended in violence and chaos, placing the protagonists squarely in the context of Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s monumental opening of the West, which stalled with the War of 1812.<br><br></p><p>Larry E. Morris is the author of The Fate of the Corps, which was named a Top Academic Title by Choice and a History Book Club selection. Morris has published articles on early Western history in such periodicals as The Missouri Historical Review, American History, and We Proceeded On. He is a senior editor with the Joseph Smith Papers Project. He and his wife, Deborah, have four children&#x2014;Isaac, Courtney, Justin, and Whitney&#x2014;and live in Salt Lake City.Morris (The Fate of the Corps: What Became of the Lewis and Clark Explorers After the Expedition) here focuses on the early 1800s Western fur trade, beginning with Robert McClellan and Ramsey Crooks, both of whom started up the Missouri River in 1806, each meeting the returning Lewis and Clark expedition. Despite the title, the adventures of many more than seven major historical figures are presented here in a single integrated narrative about the search for a new overland route to reach the Oregon country. Prominently featured is Marie Dorion, the Iowa Indian wife of interpreter and hunter Pierre Dorian Jr. In 1811&#x2013;12 she became the second woman in recorded Western history to travel cross-country to the Pacific Ocean, with voyageurs employed by St. Louis fur merchant Wilson Price Hunt. Marie Dorion&#x2019;s adventures parallel those of Sacagawea of the Lewis and Clark expedition; the two women even seem to have befriended each other between 1809 and 1811. VERDICT Highly recommended for both specialists and general readers, this history of the Western fur trade and early explorers along the Oregon Trail is a welcome addition to the literature. (<i>Library Journal, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s 1804 expedition prompted numerous similar attempts to explore and exploit the West, paving the way for cutthroat rivalries and revolving partnerships between competing fur traders, trappers, and native peoples. Morris (The Fate of the Corps) takes a scholarly look at the ill-fated lives of seven explorers, including an abused and pregnant Native American who ventured with her two small children through hostile territory and endured intense deprivation. While noted fur company owners such as John Jacob Astor waged economic war against other well-heeled rivals, the ruthlessness and bitterness was much more personal for trappers deep in various Native American hunting grounds, where they fought natural obstacles like unforgiving storms and the raging Snake River, as well as each other. The detailed descriptions of these dangerous treks render some of the lesser-known pioneers interchangeable in their misery and struggles; the appendix of biographical histories and chronology is crucial for armchair navigation. Although the expeditions are sometimes difficult to track, Morris offers a revealing look behind frontier fatalism and the drive to be the first to discover&#x2014;and capitalize on&#x2014;America&#x2019;s hidden resources. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Written for academics and history buffs alike, Larry E. Morris has provided a new perspective of six noteworthy frontiersmen and one female who made their marks in the exploration of the early American West. . .He paints good word pictures in the reader's mind and provides the reader with a new appreciation for the fur traders, trappers, and Indians involved in founding the Oregon Trail. . .Morris captures with intensity the lives, events, and hardships experienced by those involved as they sought to make their marks for history. (<i>Overland Journal</i>)<br><br>In this interpretation of western history, the West becomes the backdrop for an exciting story of heroic and entrepreneurial men who overcome great obstacles to expand the reach and operation of American society, economy, capital, and governance. (<i>Oregon Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Larry E. Morris, the author of this appropriately titled work, has done three things well. First, he has chosen a long-untreated story with appropriate respect and found its nuances. In doing so he inspires the reader's interest in learning and highlights the pure joy of discovering history. Second, he presents comprehensive references, analytical notes, and concise biographical profiles about various characters in a lastingly useful manner. Resources are created in the text and an appendix, providing a foundation for further study by even the most casual reader. Finally, he leaves the reader wanting more - more detail, more substance, and more references still. ... The Perilous West is a thoughtful study in chance and the potential influence of individual human beings on the course of events of an entire nation. ... The Perilous West will make an excellent reference work that will be a lasting credit to author and publisher alike. (<i>Annals of Wyoming</i>)<br><br>The Perilous West is both a tribute . . . as well as a useful reference work bridging the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the heyday of the Rocky Mountain fur trade. . . .Morris has done his homework and his genealogical research goes far in providing new information on many obscure or poorly-documented individuals. (<i>We Proceeded On</i>)<br><br>Even as Morris is providing a competent survey of events on the northern Great Plains and the Rockies in the wake of Lewis and Clark, he also effectively demonstrates just how perilous this West could be for Euro-Americans. All too frequently adrift in territories completely foreign to them and confronted by some indigenous peoples intolerant of intruders, the ranks of the earliest Euro-American voyagers were drastically thinned by starvation, drowning, disease, and battle. As Morris describes such events, he redirects the reader&#x2019;s attention to those relatively anonymous figures, such as John Hoback, Jacob Reznor, and Edward Robinson. . . .Morris also sheds light on an intriguing family, the Dorions, who played their own significant role in the arrival of American exploration and enterprise in the Great Plains and the Rockies. By doing so, Morris reminds us, in his own way, of the importance of family and kinship. . . . [T]hose readers who wish to bolster their understanding of the American republic&#x2019;s tentative first steps into the worlds around, above, and beyond the Missouri at the dawn of the nineteenth century would find much of value in this volume. (<i>Great Plains Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Larry Morris picks up where he left off with his previous examination of men who made up the Corps of Discovery to present the too often neglected stories of seven early frontiersmen and their influence on the exploration of the West. Morris brings fresh insight to this study of several important individuals who made significant contributions to an expanding nation following the return of Lewis and Clark. Though each character examined in the book has their own exciting story of gripping adventure, Morris does a splendid job weaving their inter-related involvement in a young Rocky Mountain fur trade into a well-researched, concise narrative, bringing long-awaited recognition to seven people who impacted the creation of the Oregon Trail.

Clear the area. Now!" Isaac's commanding tone left no doubt of his seriousness.<br><br>"Why? What do you see?"<br><br>"Nothing," Isaac said. "But Abby senses something's wrong and that's good enough for me."<br><br>Delvecchio was already shouting into his radio. Patrol officers immediately began to shoo bystanders farther away from the monument.<br><br>Isaac moved forward with Abby. "Seek it, girl. Seek it."<br><br>They didn't have far to go. The little beagle cut straight across the inner circle, zeroed in on a briefcase leaning against the base of one of the concrete benches that ringed the obelisk and plunked down into a sit.<br><br>"I have a suspicious object on the west side, at about two o'clock from the police staging area," Isaac reported via the com-link.<br><br>His new orders followed in moments. "Secure the area and pull back to a safe distance. Bomb squad is on its way."<br><br>"Copy."<br><br>He scooped up his dog, checked to make sure no one else remained nearby and would be in danger, then began to jog away.<br><br>As he ran, time seemed to slow unnaturally. His feet weighed a ton, making him feel as if he were slogging through cold molasses.<br><br>Tension grew with every step, pressing against him and making his heart pound.<br><br>Abby was trembling as though she sensed impending doom.<br><br>Suddenly, a concussion rocked the atmosphere. Isaac saw the flash through his closed eyelids an instant before he heard the blast.<br><br>Instinct made him hunch over his dog's body to protect her as he was knocked to his knees by the force of the explosion.<br><br>Most of the debris it created fell like fistfuls of tossed pebbles, but a few chunks of concrete were heavy enough, large and jagged enough, to do damage.<br><br>One piece grazed his shoulder. Another hit the back of his lower leg. Both stunned him rather than caused immediate pain.<br><br><i>How could this have happened? Abby is never wrong.</i><br><br>Which meant that the bomb had to have been placed there <i>after</i> he and the dog had made their rounds. That fact should narrow the list of suspects considerably.<br><br>Propping himself on one elbow with the other arm gripping his wiggling partner, Isaac tried to blink the grit from his watering eyes. Gray, cloudy residue filled the air. People coughed and wheezed. Many were in full flight while a few others had paused with cell phones to take macabre pictures of the chaos.<br><br>Isaac rolled into a sitting position and brushed himself off. He first checked to make sure Abby was all right, then peered back toward the source of the blast to check for casualties.<br><br>"Please, God," he prayed, "let my warning have been in time."<br><br>He rubbed his smarting eyes on the sleeve of his uniform jacket. It looked as if there were some injuries but the apparent victims were all on their feet. A few were reeling and being assisted by police and friends. Others appeared merely stunned. A cacophony of horns and sirens filled the night.<br><br>Ears ringing, head spinning, Isaac knew what he must do. There was no time to waste. Where there was one bomb there could easily be another. And another.<br><br>He wanted to lie back on the cool grass, close his eyes and wait for full recovery of his senses, but that was not how he and his fellow K-9 officers operated. The public came first. He'd tend his wounds later. As long as Abby was all right, they'd keep doing their job.<br><br>Isaac tightened up on the leash, struggled to his feet and took a step forward. His calf muscles knotted.<br><br>Intense pain radiated from his boot to his hip and dropped him where he stood.<br><br>The flow of patients through the ER at DC General Hospital had been surprisingly sparse for a balmy spring evening. Daniella Dunne stifled a yawn and smiled at a fellow RN who was also battling to stay alert.<br><br>"Every time we have a slow night I wonder why I like this shift so much," Daniella remarked.<br><br>"Because you crave adrenaline just like the rest of us," the older woman replied. "When this place starts to really hop we all feel a lot more alive."<br><br>"I suppose you're right." As far as Daniella was concerned, staying awake half the night was profoundly better than working days when so many more reporters and photographers were liable to be on the job. The last thing she needed was to become an unwilling star of some viral video. She'd matured and changed her hair color from blond to brunette, long to shorter, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be recognized by the same criminal element that had caused her to enter witness protection in the first place.<br><br>"Prepare for casualties," someone shouted. "There's just been an incident at the Washington Monument!"<br><br>Daniella froze for a heartbeat, then jumped to her feet and hurried down the hallway to the ambulance receiving area, where the majority of the night shift was gathering around a police scanner.<br><br>"Was it an accident?" one of the young orderlies asked.<br><br>"Doesn't sound like it. The first responders pegged it as a bomb," someone else answered.<br><br>Daniella clenched her fists. Her stomach churned. She suddenly saw herself as a frightened teenager again and pictured her father being arrested for the bombing death of her mother. Ten long years had passed since then, yet those terrible memories were as vivid as if everything had just happened.<br><br>Her initial disbelief about her mother's fate had quickly been supplanted with righteous anger, especially when she'd heard her estranged father begin to laugh. <i>Laugh!</i> And so she had done the only thing she could. She had mustered her courage and agreed to testify against him in court.<br><br>While most of the ER staff remained gathered around the scanner, Daniella eased away and headed for the hospital chapel.<br><br>Until the victims of this current attack arrived for treatment, the best thing she could do was pray. Fervently. The way she had prayed for her mother&#x2014;even though she'd known in her deepest heart that Mama's survival was impossible.<br><br>Being incapacitated made Isaac frustrated and angry. He'd repeatedly waved off paramedics, sending them to tend to others. As the area was systematically cleared, however, he realized he was eventually going to have to let the medics look at his throbbing leg.<br><br>Detective Delvecchio approached. "I wondered where you'd gotten to. Is Abby all right?"<br><br>"Yes." Isaac tried to rise and was stopped by the other man's hand on his shoulder. "Relax, man."<br><br>"I can't. There's work to do. What if there's a second bomb?"<br><br>"If there is, your team will find it. Some of them are sweeping the area now. So far, so good."<br><br>Isaac heaved a sigh. "Thank God&#x2014;literally."<br><br>"I have been. Particularly since there don't seem to be any life-threatening injuries."<br><br>"That's a relief."<br><br>"Yeah, and a surprise. So, are you ready to go to the hospital?"<br><br>The detective offered a hand and Isaac took it, grimacing as he rose. Standing wasn't too painful as long as he kept weight off his injured leg by leaning on David's shoulder.<br><br>"If you can make it to my car I'll drive you to the ER."<br><br>"That's against protocol."<br><br>"Your choice," Delvecchio said, arching a brow. "All the ambulances are busy. I consider this an extenuating circumstance, but it's up to you. Do you want to wait?"<br><br>"No." Isaac leaned slightly to glance at his calf. Blood had stuck the dark fabric of his uniform to his lower leg but seemed to have stopped flowing for the present.<br><br>"Why don't you help me to my car so I don't get yours dirty?"<br><br>"That's what plastic sheets are for," the detective said with a slight smile. "There's no way I'm letting you drive in your condition. I saw you send the medics to other victims and I figured it was high time you got some TLC yourself."<br><br>Isaac managed a smile. "No offense, buddy, but I'd rather have a pretty nurse taking care of me than a bossy cop like you."<br><br>Chuckling, Delvecchio slipped his arm around Isaac's waist for added support and started to move toward his unmarked car. "I'll see what I can do about finding the right nurse when we get to the hospital. What about Abby?"<br><br>"I'll handle my dog. You just get me to a doctor who can sew me up so I can go back to work."<br><br>"You're pushing it again."<br><br>Isaac sobered, glancing over his shoulder. "I know. But I feel responsible for what happened tonight and I intend to catch whoever did this."<br><br>"I've already ordered every news crew to give me copies of their raw footage. My men are also collecting the shots taken by bystanders so we can run facial recognition on anyone we don't know."<br><br>Pausing, Isaac gave the man a serious look. "Don't just concentrate on strangers. Watch the politicians, too, particularly Harland Jeffries and his staff. Considering his long-standing reputation in dirty politics, I wouldn't put it past him to try to create sympathy by pretending to be exposed to possible injury. It wouldn't be the first lie he'd ever told."<br><br>Isaac got a sinking feeling when David shook his head. "I strongly doubt that's what took place tonight," the detective said.<br><br>"Why? Was he hurt in the blast?"<br><br>"No. He may be a master manipulator but he was complaining of chest pains when they hauled him away. If this bomb scare was supposed to boost his chances of getting his new crime bill passed and it caused him to have a heart attack instead, he badly miscalculated."<br><br>Daniella had been working behind the scenes while one of the on-call doctors did triage on the victims. None seemed badly hurt and outside of a little first aid, a few stitches and a tranquilizer here and there, they had been easy to treat.<br><br>She was cleaning up one of the exam cubicles and hoping she could avoid the reporters who were still milling around the lobby when the head nurse separated a gap in the heavy curtains.<br><br>"I've got another victim here&#x2014;brought in by private vehicle. All the doctors are busy and we're out of wheelchairs. Take care of him for me, will you?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Daniella relieved the other nurse and slipped her arm around the uniformed officer's waist, starting to guide him. She was careful to avert her face for the brief moments when she was exposed to the public, hoping no cameras would capture her image. That was when she noted the leash in the patient's hand. "I'm terribly sorry. You can't bring a dog into the hospital."<br><br>"This isn't a dog."<br><br>"Sure looks like one."<br><br>"Nope. This is officer Abby of the Capitol K-9 Unit. See her vest?"<br><br>"She's still a dog."<br><br>"I beg to differ. You permit service dogs, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes, of course, but..."<br><br>"Then you have to allow Abby in. Besides, I'm injured and she's my partner. She goes where I go."<br><br>"Do you promise to take the flak if the hospital administration finds out and pitches a fit?"<br><br>"No problem. I'm already wearing a flak vest under my jacket." He glanced toward the foyer, where Delvec-chio was speaking to additional reporters. "Don't I have to fill out paperwork?"<br><br>The direct answer was yes. Daniella chose to handle it another way in order to keep her distance from the news crews. "I can help you with those details while you hold your dog&#x2014;I mean your partner."<br><br>She helped him lie down and lifted his boots to rest on the narrow exam table. When she picked up a PDA and began poking its screen with a stylus, she wished her hands would stop shaking. "Your name, please?"<br><br>"Isaac Black. How long have you worked in ER?" he asked, frowning.<br><br>When his fascinating, dark gaze locked with her green eyes she could barely force herself to look away. "Seven years. Why?"<br><br>"Because you're acting awfully nervous. You aren't afraid of dogs, are you?"<br><br>"Don't be silly. I love animals."<br><br>"Then what's wrong? If you had already examined my leg I'd think I was hurt worse than I'd imagined."<br><br>"I'm sure you'll be fine, Mr.&#x2014;I mean Officer&#x2014;<br><br>Black."<br><br>"May as well call me Isaac. It solves lots of problems."<br><br>"Fine. Can you put the dog on a chair long enough for you to be treated?"<br><br>"Of course. If I'd been able to drive myself over here I'd have left her at headquarters. Unfortunately, I was overruled."<br><br>"A wise decision," Daniella said. She laid the tablet aside while her patient pointed to a chair and the beagle obediently jumped into it.<br><br>"I'm impressed," she said. "My cat barely comes when I call him for supper."<br><br>"Not surprising. Cats have devious minds."<br><br>If he hadn't been smiling at her, Daniella might have thought he was serious. "That's debatable."<br><br>The resulting twinkle in his dark eyes was so appealing she had to force herself to look away. He was taller than most of the men she knew, and far more muscular. His smile was amiable enough, yet there was an aura about him that made her think of danger. Either that or she was simply being influenced by the disquieting thoughts that had begun the moment she'd heard the news of an explosion.<br><br>Once she had recorded Isaac's necessary preliminary information, she slit the leg of his uniform pants the rest of the way to his knee, folded back the fabric and carefully removed his boot.<br><br>"Well? How bad is it?" he asked.</p><h2>Jules Breton and the French Rural Tradition</h2><p>Jules Breton and the French Rural Tradition by Sturges, Hollister et al.</p><p></p><h2>The Rich Tradition of European Peasant Cookery</h2><p>The warm glow of embers in the hearth, a savoury broth simmering in the cooking pot, a flitch of bacon smoking in the chimney - until recently these were not nostalgic pleasures, they were the stuff of life. European peasant cookery is as much part of our heritage as our cathedrals and castles, the foundation on which all our subsequent cuisines are based. It developed locally, according to the climate and the availability of foodstuffs, changing only slightly to incorporate new ingredients as trade routes opened up. A rich oral tradition, passed down through the generations, peasant cookery offers healthy, real food - the antithesis of fast-food catering - and is as relevant now as it was centuries ago. This book records the bedrock of European cookery and rediscovers what has been lost through over-refinement. The sixteen chapters each deal with a basic ingredient - from &#34;Fish and Food from the Sea&#34; and &#34;Pork and Storehouse Meats&#34; to &#34;Herbs and Fungi&#34; and &#34;Fruits, Berries and Nuts&#34; and each of the over 500 recipes including suggestions for varying the dish and for appropriate accompaniments, including wine.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic School Bus: Inside a Volcano (The Magic School Bus) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] Earhart, Kristin</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Hoshin Engi, Vol. 3 (3)</h2><p>Taikobo gets more than he bargained for when he takes over the protection of two young princes prophesized to be part of a much larger master plan.

But make no mistake&#x2013;there truly is much to beware for those who are drawn to risk their lives and seek their fortunes upon the waves. And perhaps none take more chances than the men and women who brave the tempestuous, bountiful waters of the Bering Sea. Season after season, they bond and battle with its icy depths, determined to reap yet one more rewarding harvest while eluding the ever-present threat of sudden, certain death. And among the rapidly diminishing ranks of these die-hard salts, brothers Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand have forged a reputation as fierce masters of their treacherous, enthralling trade. If you&#x2019;ve watched their exploits on TV&#x2019;s Deadliest Catc<i>h</i>, you&#x2019;ve only scratched the surface. To read Time Bandit is to step into their skins, smell the sea air, feel the frigid wind, and know with all your senses the exhilarating, and terrifying life on the edge.<br><br>Natives of tiny, fishing hamlet, Homer, Alaska; sons of a hard-bitten, highly successful fisherman; and born with brine in their blood, the Hillstrand boys couldn&#x2019;t imagine a life without a swaying deck underfoot and a harvest of mighty Alaskan king crabs waiting to be pulled from the ocean floor. In pursuit of their daily catch, the brothers brave ice floes and heaving waves 60 feet high, the perils of 1000-lb steel traps thrown about by the punishing wind, and the constant menace of the open, hungry water.<br><br>Even the brothers&#x2019; downtime on land&#x2013;where the deadly realities of the unforgiving sea are never far from their minds&#x2013;is lived as if borrowed: fast and hard, haunted by the knowledge that the next season at sea could end asleep in the deep.<br><br>Here is the Hillstrands&#x2019; own heartfelt hymn to the brutally hard, gloriously independent, and mysteriously soul-satisfying life that has earned them their daily bread and defined their existence. By turns raucous and reflective, exhilarating and anguished, enthralling, suspenseful, and wise, Time Bandit chronicles a larger-than-life love affair as old as civilization itself&#x2013;a love affair between striving, willful man and inscrutable, enduring nature.</p><p>On board Time Bandit, their family owned and operated vessel, brothers Johnathan and Andy Hillstrand share the skippering duties. Johnathan, a resident of Homer, Alaska, takes the helm during the king crab season. When not on deck, chances are he can be found on the back of his Harley Fat Boy. During opilio season it is Andy who sits in the wheelhouse. In the off-season, however, he can be found training horses on his ranch in Indiana.<br><br>Malcolm MacPherson is a former correspondent for Newsweek and the author of more a dozen books including most recently the satirical war novel Hocus Potus and the nonfiction account of battle in Afghanistan, Roberts Ridge.

I am tagged as a &#x201c;bad boy of the Bering Sea&#x201d; in &#x201c;the deadliest profession in America.&#x201d; I have fought forty-foot seas and seen rogue waves one hundred feet high. I work on water cold enough to kill a man in five minutes, and I have bent under the power of 120-knot Williwaw winds and watched the crushing strength&nbsp; of the Arctic ice pack move south from Russia around the hull of my boat, Time Bandit. I am Johnathan Hillstrand and that is where I stand in the universe. <br><br>Right now, that might be another man&#x2019;s life, because I am drifting in a small boat without power, alone, and with no help in sight. Waves no taller than my forearm lap the hull with a rhythm that makes me want to dream. Nothing here threatens me. The sky is a washed-out blue without a cloud to the horizon in every direction. <br><br>It&#x2019;s creeping me out. <br><br>The boat I am on, a thirty-eight-foot Weggley gill-netter I named fishing vessel (F/V) Fishing Fever, bobs with the tide in full ebb at about four knots. The boat and I are captives of a moon that pulls us southwestward. I am, I can only estimate, fifty to sixty miles southwest of the mouth of the Kasilof River where I started this morning. I have about ten dozen fat, fresh, Cook Inlet, red sockeye salmon on ice in my tanks. I care where the tide is drifting me (not just because going where I do not want to go is an inconvenience); I would prefer to be back at fishing camp by nightfall with my buddies in the junkyard behind the Kasilof cannery with a bottle of Crown Royal in one hand and a hot dog in the other, telling stories around an oil-drum fire. Almost certainly, that will not happen. <br><br>I started drifting when Fishing Fever&#x2019;s engine blew up more than three hours ago. The reduction gear fried with a grunt, and the boat shuddered and died like it had been sapped. The demise did not come as a complete surprise. The boat&#x2019;s former owner never changed the oil, and the engine was flooded twice. I bought the boat four years ago because I liked the shape of its hull, not the thrum of its engine. The blame is also mine. I had gunned the engine at stressful rpms back and forth along the hundred-yard length of the gill net in an attempt to herd the spawning salmon toward the mesh. I cannot make repairs to the reduction gear until I can get back to Kasilof, lay the boat on the mud, and get a mechanic in the tiny engine compartment with wrenches. I opened up the cover and squeezed myself&#x2014;I am 6&#x2019; 1&#x201d; and weigh 205 pounds&#x2014;behind the drive shaft for a look. The shaft is not spinning, and clear oil leaks in the reduction gear when I turn the engine off. Murphy&#x2019;s Law works on water as well as on land. My batteries are not charging. I am leaking power slowly. With batteries fading, no motor, no radios, I am, in a word, fucked. <br><br>I shut the cover, wishing I could forget what I saw. <br><br>The tide is drifting me faster than I like in the direction of Augustine Island and beyond, into the Shelikof Strait, where anything can happen, and sometimes does. In his ship&#x2019;s log, Captain Cook supposedly wrote that the second worst weather and currents on earth, after Cape Horn, can be found in the Strait. Like the Bering Sea where my brother and I fish, storms come up in the Strait with startling speed and a violence that can turn a pond into a maelstrom in six hours, and often less. The winds whip off the icy fjord walls that overlook the Strait; currents from the Kennedy Entrance compete with currents from the Cook Inlet, Kachemak Bay, the Gulf of Alaska, and several tidal rips. Put together, these produce swells like nowhere else in Alaska. I look at my watch. As we say, shit happens when you party naked. <br><br>It was not long ago that I was caught in the Strait. It was blowing eighty. I looked out and shouted into an indifferent and wild wind. I was coming in to shelter in a cove when I saw a man on the water in what looked like a canoe. He was waving a red coat. I did not believe my eyes. My deckhand and friend, Codfish Tom, woke up and looked to verify the sight. Codfish is a big dude with a head big enough to have its own gravity, its own atmosphere, its own weather system. I asked him, &#x201c;Do you see that, Codfish?&#x201d; <br><br>He said, &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make sense.&#x201d; <br><br>Three guys were sitting on the bottom of a boat no bigger than Fishing Fever; the storm had capsized their craft with only the bow sticking out. The men were dying slowly of hypothermia, bleeding out body warmth twenty-four times faster than they would in air the same temperature as the water. A bitter cold was reaching its icy fingers into the core of their hearts. They had no survival suits. I jumped into the water in my survival suit to save them. They had no strength when I reached them. One of them sank. He just gave up and headed to the bottom. I grabbed him by the hair and pulled him up for breath. One by one I brought them onboard my boat and gave them hot coffee and cigarettes and dry clothes. I quickly flipped through the pages in a book for advice on treating hypothermia, where I learned that under no circumstances was I to give them coffee or cigarettes. I smacked the smokes out of their mouths. One guy could not talk he was so cold. I kept asking him, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name? Tell me your name.&#x201d; to keep him alive. The man I pulled out by the hair later tattooed the name of my boat on his arm: Arctic Nomad. <br><br>We sheltered in that cove, with them aboard, until the storm subsided. There was nothing else we could do. <br><br>So I know the weather in the Strait. I know about the cold and what Alaskan waters can do. The Coast Guard does not mandate 406/121.5 MHZ EPIRBs, an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, on boats the size of Fishing Fever. EPIRBs automatically beam a Mayday and identifying signal and location to a satellite and down to the Coast Guard in Juneau. Without an EPIRB, I might as well not exist in a crisis. Not that the Coast Guard would tow me in if they knew, unless I was about to go under; maritime law assigns liability for a broken boat to the boat that tows her in, and the Coast Guard, while a reassuring presence, does not view itself as AAA. <br><br>Making matters worse, Fishing Fever does not carry a single sideband radio; no other boat in the Cook Inlet red salmon fleet does either. My VHF went screwy when the engine quit; I have been losing batteries all morning (and besides, VHF channel 16 reaches only about 20 miles). My Razr cell phone could not find a signal this far out in the bland wilderness of the sea even if I had not thrown it on the oil-drum fire last night. By the time I fished it out of the flames it looked like a s&#x2019;more. At least as far as technology goes, I would be better off right now in the era of James Cook with sail, sextant, and pennant signal flags. <br><br>I stayed up last night getting drunk. I stopped counting at eighteen double shots. There is too much Crown Royal in this world and not enough willpower. I was out of control. At the camp, my fellow drift netters and I decided to fish the next day according to where we threw magnetic darts at a silhouette of a naked woman we had drawn on the side of a broken-down white van. I hit the lower regions, which put me down on the south line for the opening. With that much decided, we talked about what we talk about at fishing camp&#x2014;fishing, boats, gadgets, and women, in that order. We did not get to the topic of women before the Crown Royal got to me. The last thing I remember, I was telling my buddies about the time my brother Andy and I were fishing for red king crabs in Bristol Bay. We were trying an experiment with a TV camera that we had contained in a watertight box that we were towing underwater to help us locate crabs, which roll along the sea floor in balls fifteen feet high. Sometimes they migrate as many as four miles in a day. Andy and I were staring into the TV monitor when suddenly a human arm floated by wearing the orange sleeve of a seaman&#x2019;s rain slicker, with a blue rubber glove on its hand. Where the rest of the body went, who could say? <br><br>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; I asked Andy. <br><br>He said, &#x201c;I saw it. Did you see it?&#x201d; <br><br>We started to laugh&#x2014;a psychotic, not a funny, laugh. Just then, at that exact moment, we felt a bump against the hull.

Fishing was set to open at seven and would close twelve hours later. I did not want to be a minute late. My friends from camp followed me out through the darkness into the Inlet. At this moment, while I drift, they are netting their catch somewhere out of sight to the northeast of me. <br><br>To me, gillnetting salmon is fishing. I hate to miss a minute of the fun. I fish for red king and opilio crabs in winter to help pay for salmon netting in summer. I never can seem to make money off salmon. I do not know why. And I really do not care. I love the camp, the guys, the fish, and the fishing. To me the pleasures are worth breaking even. Sockeye salmon are the most beautiful fish in the world. They are the first to come upriver and are the biggest and nicest. This year I will get $1.10 a pound for them. But that is not what draws me out on the water year after year. The ritual of catching them reminds me of the old ways: One man, one boat, and one sea.

He lives in California. <br> <br> Read on for Williams and Christopher Paolini's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br> <br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br> <br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one Of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br> <br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br> <br> That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <b> Read the full conversation </b><b>Christopher Paolini</b> is the author of <i>Eragon</i> and<i> Eldest</i>, the first two books in the Inheritance Cycle.

The book presents a wealth of previously unpublished information about Stravinsky&#39;s relationships with other musicians, and about his methods of composition. The opening section, based on letters to Stravinsky from his first wife Catherine, is among the most important material yet made available for an understanding of the composer&#39;s personal and family life.If the exchanges with Auden (The Rake&#39;s Progress) and Cocteau (Oedipus Rex) take first place for general interest, the letters to Ansermet - who conducted more performances of Stravinsky&#39;s music than anyone but the composer himself - give a remarkable view of the musical and ballet worlds, especially of the Diaghilev period, and of the great impresario himself. This book, accompanied by two further volumes, is a major contribution to the Stravinsky canon and to the cultural history of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><h2>Bountiful Bonsai: Create Instant Indoor Container Gardens with Edible Fruits, Herbs and Flowers</h2><p>Bonsai&#x2014;the Japanese art of training plants to form elegant sculptures&#x2014;is an age-old craft that appeals to gardeners and non-gardeners alike. <i>Bountiful Bonsai</i> presents a radical, new approach that applies bonsai techniques to everyday container gardening, instantly turning houseplants and herbs into beautiful and unusual bonsai sculptures!<br><br>Bonsai expert Richard Bender not only expects his plants to look good but also expects to yield pleasant fragrances, fresh herbs and fruits for his table.

In <i>Packing for Mars</i>, Roach tackles the strange science of space travel, and the psychology, technology, and politics that go into sending a crew into orbit. Roach is unfailingly inquisitive (Why is it impolite for astronauts to float upside down during conversations? Just how smelly does a spacecraft get after a two week mission?), and she eagerly seeks out the stories that don't make it onto NASA's website--from SPCA-certified space suits for chimps, to the trial-and-error approach to crafting menus during the space program's early years (when the chefs are former livestock veterinarians, taste isn't high on the priority list). <i>Packing for Mars</i> is a book for grownups who still secretly dream of being astronauts, and Roach lives it up on their behalf--weightless in a C-9 aircraft, she just can't resist the opportunity to go "Supermanning" around the cabin.

He wonders whether shards of that mirror, which have the power to turn people's hearts to ice, still exist. A few years later, when the Nazis imprison his family in a concentration camp, he knows that they do. <p>By the end of the war, Moishe is the only one of his family still alive, and he no longer wants to be Jewish. He tells the AMerican liberators he is a Gypsy named Danny and i sent to a Catholic orphanage. WHen his best friend at the orphanage is adopted, Moishe is unable to bear yet another loss in his short life. He runs away. Yet when all seems utterly hopeless, he learns that the light of Sabbath candles is warm enough to melt the ice that has formed in his own heart. </p><p>In this moving story of a young boy's flight from his past, legendary actor and acclaimed author Kirk Douglas reminds us that sometimes we must embrace our most painful memories to uncover a brighter future. He tells a timeless tale of loss of faith and its recovery.</p>Grade 4-7. Historical facts are presented with a heavy hand throughout this story about Moishe and his family. The disparate reactions of Jews to what is happening in Germany in 1939 is clearly represented by the boy's mother's assurance that these "hooligans" (the Nazis) will soon go away, his father's caution in relocating the family to a farm, and their neighbors' exodus from the country. Characters are two-dimensional, except for Moishe, who is only slightly more fleshed out. His older sister is angelic even to the point of her understanding response to her family's betrayal by the German handyman who is responsible for their removal to a concentration camp. Moishe is the only family member to survive; he is rescued and winds up in a Catholic orphanage in the United States after denying that he is Jewish. Conveniently, the story ends with him finding his Jewish identity once again as he wanders into a synagogue and is miraculously taken in and ultimately adopted by the rabbi and his family.

For Elias specialises in lawsuits alleging police brutality, racism and corruption and every LAPD cop is a possible suspect in his killing. Detective Harry Bosch is put in charge. Elias&#39;s murder occurred on the eve of a major trial: on behalf of a black client, Michael Harris, Elias was to bring a civil case against the LAPD for violent interrogation tactics that had caused his client the partial loss of his hearing. Harris had been acquitted of the rape and murder of a twelve-year-old girl, but many, including Bosch, believe him guilty.......&#34;</p><p>Michael Connelly, whose novel <i>The Poet</i> won the 1997 Anthony Award for Best Mystery, is already recognized as one of the smartest and most vivid scribes of the hard-boiled police procedural. Now, with his much-anticipated sixth Harry Bosch novel, <i>Angels Flight</i>, Connelly offers one of the finest pieces of mystery writing to appear in 1998. Bosch is awakened in the middle of the night and, out of rotation, he is assigned to the murder investigation of the high-profile African American attorney Howard Elias. When Bosch arrives at the scene, it seems that almost the entire LAPD is present, including the IAD (the Internal Affairs Division). Elias, who made a career out of suing the police, was sadistically gunned down on the Angels Flight tram just as he was beginning a case that would have struck the core of the department; not surprisingly, L.A.'s men and women in blue become the center of the investigation. Haunted by the ghost of the L.A. riots, plagued by incessant media attention, and facing turmoil at home, Bosch suddenly finds himself questioning friends and associates while working side by side with some longtime enemies. <p> <i>Angels Flight</i> is a detective's nightmare scenario and is disturbingly relevant to the racially tense last decade of the 20th century. Amidst the twists and turns of his complex narrative, Connelly affirms his rightful place among the masters of contemporary mystery fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and author of the bestselling series of Harry Bosch novels and the bestselling novels Chasing the Dime, The Poet, Blood Work, and Void Moon.

He orchestrated the injunction hearings on the Dodge Main strike and defended the legality of the sit-down tactic. As the UAW's General Council, he wrote the union's constitution in 1939, a model of democratic thinking. Sugar worked with George Addes, UAW Secretary-Treasurer, to nurture rank-and-file power. A founder of the National Lawyers' Guild, Sugar also served as a member of Detroit's Common Council at the head of a UAW "labor" ticket.</p><p>By 1947, Sugar was embroiled in a struggle within the UAW that he feared would destroy the open structures he had helped to build. He found himself in opposition to Walter Reuther's bid to run the union. A long-time socialist, Sugar fell victim to mounting Cold War hysteria. When Reuther assumed control of the UAW, Sugar was summarily dismissed.</p><p>Christopher Johnson chronicles the life of Maurice Sugar, from his roots in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, through his resistance with Eugene V Debs to World War I, and on to the struggles of the early 1930s to bring the union message to Detroit. Firmly grounded on the historiography of the UAW, Johnson shows the importance of Sugar and the Left in laying the foundation for unionizing the auto industry in the pre-UAW days. He documents the work of the Left in building a Black-labor coalition in Detroit, the importance of anti-Communism in Reuther's rise to power, and the diminution of union democracy in the UAW brought about by the Cold War. Maurice Sugar represents a force in American life that bears recalling in these barren years of plant closings.</p></p><p>Christopher Johnson chronicles the life of Maurice Sugar, from his roots in Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula, through his resistance with Eugene V Debs to World War I, and on to the struggles of the early 1930s to bring the union message to Detroit.Christopher H.

When the Franks leave Frankfurt for Amsterdam, they are hoping to find a place where they can resume a normal life, but instead, the family's freedoms are taken away bit by bit. But it is when they see that other Jews are being taken away, and sent to so-called labor camps that the Franks realize they have no choice but to go into hiding; they live in fear for 2 years.</p><p>Grade 5-9&#x2013;Denenberg is clearly passionate about his subject. Unfortunately, his enthusiasm doesn't translate into a thoughtful, well-written biography. One problem is his audience: the introduction and bibliographical essay are directed at adults, while the text swings from upper elementary to high school (and back again). Second, the writing is often awkward and choppy, with an annoying use of sentence fragments. Third, there are many errors, omissions, and unanswered questions. Finally, the book's four sections are disjointed. "Living" is a straightforward narrative. In "Hiding," Denenberg covers the Franks' years in the Secret Annex through a fictional diary "written" by Anne's sister, Margot. In his introduction he claims that this made-up diary accomplishes six "important things," but it doesn't. There are a number of discrepancies between Margot's "diary" and Anne's. And, by not quoting any of Anne's entries, key insights into her personality, feelings and beliefs, and growing maturity are absent&#x2013;from her own biography. "Dying" uses oral histories of concentration-camp survivors. "Surviving" is disappointingly brief and ends abruptly with the publication of Anne's diary. There is nothing about the play or movie/TV adaptations, nothing on the Anne Frank House or Foundation, nothing on the controversies that have arisen regarding the diary's authenticity (and how it was edited), and&#x2013;most importantly&#x2013;nothing about the diary's enormous impact. While not totally satisfactory, Susan Goldman Rubin's <i>Searching for Anne Frank</i>(Abrams, 2003) is both thorough and interesting.<i>&#x2013;Ann W. Moore, Schenectady County Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* Gr. 6-10. Readers of Anne Frank's diary may think they know her story, but this thoroughly researched volume offers much more, throwing light on the lives of Anne and her family before, during, and after the years in the secret annex. The first section discusses the Franks' life in Germany when Hitler came to power, their move to Amsterdam, and their lives during the next nine years. The second section, a fictional diary in the voice of Anne's older sister Margot, offers a slightly different perspective on the time the family spent in hiding. Returning to nonfiction, the third and fourth sections recount what happened to the family members when they were discovered and sent to concentration camps, and describe Otto Frank's postwar efforts to find his daughters and the publication of Anne's diary. Inserting a fictional diary into a nonfiction work was an unusual choice, but the section effectively makes the people, their relationships, and their experiences more real. While Anne's diary is affecting in a way that no other version of her story could be, readers who hunger to know more will find this informative, involving book--with source notes, a detailed time line, a bibliographic essay, and lists of further resources--a great place to turn.

Immediately her scholars jump to the conclusion that the man has been found guilty of kin-murder. The Brehon sentence for this worst of all crimes is that the murderer be towed out to sea and left to the mercy of wind and waves and the ultimate judgement of Almighty God. But Mara notices something odd about the body, something which arouses her suspicions. And something familiar about the boat in which he lies. Soon she has embarked on a full-scale murder investigation.

Green </b>was born and raised in a small New England town where she was once struck by lightning. She was a practicing CPA before leaving the corporate life to work in film production, write, and wear fewer high heels. She now lives in Los Angeles.Chapter One<br><br>VIRGINIA<br><br>Five Days After<br><br>When my half sister, Jenny, was killed, it was all over the news-national news, not just the local paper that had to use an offensively large font to fill its pages. Strangers drove great distances to be part of the fanfare. Reporters and their vans lined the street in front of the church hosting her funeral. I parked my dented Jetta along the side of the road about a quarter mile away. There was no reserved parking space for me.<br><br>St. Bernard's Cathedral was the only church aesthetically pleasing enough for my stepmother, Linda, to hold the funeral in. It was too large for the community; even Christmas Eve Mass couldn't fill more than half the pews. Not today, though. Today, the local police were turning people away.<br><br>Men and women were milling around crying, consoling each other. No one was smiling, not even the polite forced smile you use to mask pain. Just hordes of people looking truly devastated by Jenny's death. I didn't recognize any of them, and I highly doubted they had ever set foot in this town before.<br><br>A dopey uniformed officer named Brett stood at the base of the church stairs. We went to high school together. It was the type of town where no matter the age, it felt like we all went to high school together in some shape or form. He looked exhausted, and his buzz cut was useless to sponge up the beads of sweat multiplying across his forehead. He just let them grow until they dripped off and splashed onto his shirt.<br><br>Brett was a bouncer without a list, making gut decisions about who he could let into the church. I was fourth in line, an actual line that I had to wait in patiently to attend my own sister's funeral. It was my choice. I didn't deserve special treatment. I was not a good sister.<br><br>I watched Brett turn two people away before recognizing the couple in front of me and allowing them inside without hesitation. When I stepped up for my turn, he looked up carelessly, locked on my face, processed who I was, and straightened his spine.<br><br>"Virginia . . . hi. I'm very sorry for your loss."<br><br>"Thank you," I said.<br><br>"This is crazy, huh?" He finally wiped his brow, altering the trajectory of his sweat beads.<br><br>"Was I supposed to RSVP?" I joked. I probably shouldn't have. No jokes at funerals.<br><br>"Of course not," he said, too nervous to get it. "Please go on in." He stepped aside and extended his arms with such flourish it was as if I had the last golden ticket.<br><br>It was loud inside. Churches were supposed to be quiet. The noise was unsettling. A group of sobbing women who must have gotten in just before Brett took the helm filled the last two rows. They looked like they were attending the Kentucky Derby. Are funeral hats a thing?<br><br>The next few rows were a mixed bag of strange faces and town staples. It was easy to tell who the out-of-towners were because they ignored me. The people from town gave me intrusive pitying looks followed by immediate avoidance of continued eye contact. It was the same way when my mother died.<br><br>Wrenton was one of those old New England towns where the founding families all spawned from some combination of people from the Mayflower, and for a long time it was just the same names swapped around over and over again. Even though there were a lot more surnames now, it still felt to me like we were all from the same litter, destined to live and die where our ancestors had. Someday, I was going to leave and never look back-just not today.<br><br>I could see Linda in the front row amidst a few distant relatives of hers. Her outfit wasn't as on point as I'd expected. Her black skirt was wrinkled in the back, and her pleated blouse was, dare I say, frumpy. She hadn't touched her curling iron, which was a real shocker. Linda always curled her hair for events. Instead, the blonde strands, too long for her age, just fell flat against her back.<br><br>I watched her face contort and quiver as people whispered things to her with delicate smiles. I knew she was hurting, but I was struggling to muster any sympathy. Jenny was her only child, her favorite little trophy, and Linda was a parasite. Every activity was a calculated move to help Linda feed off her daughter and reinforce her fragile ego.<br><br>It was never more apparent than with the beauty pageants. From ages five to twelve, Jenny won more Grand Supreme titles than anyone else in New England. I was told about it quite often, and Linda wasn't going to let anyone in this church forget it. Gigantic glamour shots of Jenny surrounded the coffin. In each one, a dead-behind-the-eyes little girl was dressed in a slightly provocative costume with enough makeup for a roadside hooker.<br><br>You would think my half sister had been some angelic being. There were just so many stories about the pageants, and her beauty, and how big her heart was. Her potential! These people were delusional. Jenny would have been fourteen in three weeks. She hadn't done a pageant in months and was becoming a nosy little twat.<br><br>I took a seat away from Linda next to an elderly couple who smelled like a forgotten attic. I didn't know them, and they didn't know me. The elderly strangers in the church seemed less creepy to me than the younger people attending the funeral of a child they didn't know. Old people just like to go to church.<br><br>From a private door in the front, my father, the esteemed Calvin Kennedy, entered the church and joined his wife. I knew he was a suspect. The father was always a suspect in these sorts of things. Part of me hoped he was guilty. I found solace in fantasizing about all the horrible drop-the-soap-type prison clich&#x17d;s.<br><br>I was not one for being out in public for extended periods of time. In Wrenton, everyone knew everything about everyone, or tried to at least. In the minutes it took me to pay for my gas I could learn five to seven intimate facts about my neighbors. World news didn't resonate. A good story was one you had to whisper for fear that the very person you were shit-talking could be lurking just around the next corner.<br><br>My skin was crawling. I could feel the eyes on me. Suddenly, I was relevant again and my secrets were fair game. I had to get out of that church. I slipped out of the pew, kept my head down, and made my way to the exit. Another A-plus decision for Virginia Kennedy.<br><br>Jennyï¿½s funeral lasted a little over an hour. I waited outside, among the hedges to the left of the church doors. If I smoked, Iï¿½d have been smoking. Instead, I just chewed at my fingernails, trying to gnaw them even, each bite making it worse.<br><br>I could hear everything. Linda's cousin read a poem she had written that rhymed, some of Jenny's perfect little friends from school sang a song, and the priest talked forever about God choosing special children to stand by his side in heaven. The verbiage was particularly disturbing given she was raped and murdered, left to die in the woods. Seems like he could have chosen her with a lightning bolt or something.<br><br>When I heard pews creak and feet shuffle, I knew it was my time to fully commit to bailing. I hustled to my car, keeping my head down and praying I wouldn't cross paths with anyone who would attempt to engage. I didn't go to the cemetery. It was a selfish thing to do, but Jenny wouldn't know. She was too busy being God's personal assistant now.<br><br>I went home to my tiny apartment, where I could pretend nothing had happened. I could pretend nothing had happened to Jenny, or to me, or to the world. I could embrace some sort of delusional existence where I wasn't a piece-of-shit person or a piece-of-shit sister. It would be harder to hide now, now that Jenny was gone.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>JENNY<br><br>Five Weeks Before<br><br>The school bus was late on the first day, and Jenny leaned against the remnants of a rock wall, shifting her weight back and forth, bored, anxious. It was her first year in high school. Technically, she was only in eighth grade, but the student population was small, and long before she was born, the district voted to convert the former middle school building into town offices. The students were displaced. Seventh graders were crammed into the elementary school, and eighth graders moved into the high school. It was normal procedure now, but no less jarring for those making the transition. Last year Jenny had shared the halls with kindergarteners; now there was a guy with a mustache waiting for the bus.<br><br>The other students huddled together across the street from Jenny in a small area deemed to have the best cell phone reception. She wished her parents would let her have a cell phone, but there was no way they would give her one after what had happened.<br><br>Jenny was the only one who seemed to care when a faint whistling came from up the hill. She gazed toward the bend in Sanford Hill Road, anticipating the source of the sound. A lanky teenage boy in an oversized camouflage jacket, baggy jeans, and combat boots marched around the corner. Jenny recognized what he was immediately: a new kid. He looked older, maybe a junior. She stared at the stranger until it was obvious he was walking toward her, then averted her eyes, pretending to look for something in her backpack.<br><br>He sauntered over and joined Jenny at the rock wall, but left a comfortable space between them. He took a deep breath and rubbed at his thighs, preparing for an interaction she didn't care to initiate. She fidgeted with her bag, like maybe she was so enthralled with it that she hadn't noticed him. Surely he would understand because whatever she was looking for was important. Where was the freaking bus?<br><br>"Want one?" the boy asked, reaching into his coat pocket.<br><br>Jenny paused her frantic searching to look up and see him pull out a packet of cigarettes. "No, thank you," she said, even though her brain pulsed with the opportunity to do something so forbidden.<br><br>"Eh, that's good. These things are disgusting." He pulled one from the pack and returned the rest to his pocket. With his other hand, he grabbed a lighter from his jeans and lit up. "I'm hooked." He smiled as he turned his head to blow the smoke away from her.<br><br>Jenny debated going back into her bag. Would he notice that she had just given up this all-important search? Why did she even care?<br><br>"What's up with this school?" he asked. "I hate new schools. Either they assign me some hyperactive pep squad bitch to show me around, or no one knows I exist."<br><br>"We don't have a pep squad."<br><br>"Good, maybe I'll be left alone then."<br><br>"Maybe" was all Jenny could muster. He had engaged her, but now he wanted to be left alone. Mixed signals.<br><br>"Where's the bus?" he asked.<br><br>Jenny shrugged.<br><br>"You just have all the answers," he teased.<br><br>Jenny's reciprocating smile was cut short as a car came speeding down the hill, tearing through the gravel, and sliding to a stop in front of them.<br><br>Christine Castleton rolled down the window of her hand-me-down Nissan. "Hey, Jenny," she said as if they had interacted more than zero times in the past. "I have one seat left. Are you interested?" She intended for the question to be rhetorical. Of course Jenny would want a ride. Christine Castleton was a special brand of popular. After a knee injury her junior year derailed her promising athletic future, she went from golden child to intoxicating rebel. At some point over the summer, she had even dyed her hair a bright magenta, unheard of in this town.<br><br>It meant something that she was talking to Jenny. It meant something to be chosen, but Jenny froze. Her summer had been long and full of painful isolation. Her mother had made sure of that. Jenny wasn't ready for the Christine Castletons of the world. It wasn't just a car ride. It was an initiation.<br><br>"I'm going to wait for the bus," Jenny answered, trying to be casual about it, but Christine hit the gas and blew through the stop sign at the end of the road, evidencing her disapproval.<br><br>"Must be some bus," the boy she had momentarily forgotten about said before smirking. He took one last long drag from the cigarette, tossed it to the ground, and stomped it out with his combat boot. "Day one, can't wait."<br><br>The sound of diesel in the distance was the most welcome noise Jenny had ever heard. They both slid off the rock wall, and she was unsure if she should walk with him or leave their interaction at that. She took the lead, and he followed just enough behind her to show he wasn't sure either.<br><br>"I'm JP, by the way. If you cared."<br><br>"Jenny," she said, hoping this wasn't a mistake. It was her first day of high school; she hadn't even boarded the bus yet and had already rejected Christine Castleton and attached herself to a weird nobody.<br><br>JP reached out to symbolically hold the bus door open for her, and as her foot left the ground, a voice yelling in the distance demanded their attention.<br><br>"Jenny! Jenny!" her mother screamed in no particular direction as she came barreling down their driveway, running parallel to Sanford Hill Road and all too visible from the bus. Linda was in her silk bathrobe, hair wet, arms and legs flailing. "Jenny!" She spotted the bus and began a targeted sprint.<br><br>Jenny stared in shock before jumping off the bus, pushing JP out of the way. "Mom, what? Stop."<br><br>Linda threw her arms around her daughter and squeezed. "Oh my God, I didn't know where you went. I was so scared."<br><br>Jenny shoved her off. "Jesus, Mom, this is so embarrassing. Please go."<br><br>"You're right, OK, I'm sorry." Linda backed away. "Have a great first day. I love you."<br><br>Jenny rolled her eyes and headed back to the bus. Doomed.<br><br>Chapter Three<br><br>VIRGINIA<br><br>The funny thing about death is how hard everyone strives for normalcy in its wake. If we could all just pretend it didn't happen, these horrible feelings would go away. Only a week had passed since Jenny's murder, and we were having Sunday dinner. The weekly ritual was something none of us enjoyed to begin with.

It was December 1849. The U.S.-Mexican War had just ended, doubling the size of the country. A grave problem emerged: whether slavery should be admitted into the new territories that were to be carved out of the vast new domain resulting from the war. This dilemma strained the relationship between the slave-holding South and the antislavery North. Other issues loomed as well: where to draw the Texas boundary line with the New Mexico territory, how to settle the Texas debt claims, and what to do about the problem of fugitive slaves escaping to the North and the slavetrade in the District of Columbia. The nation was on the brink of secession, dissolution, and civil war. <i>On the Brink of Civil War</i> tells the dramatic story of what happened when a handful of senators-towering figures in nineteenth-century American history-tried to hammer out a compromise to save the Union. The characters in this critical political drama included Henry Clay, seasoned politician and statesman known as the "Great Pacificator," who formulated an agreement in the Senate and would fight to get it through Congress; the gifted orator Daniel Webster, who helped Clay in his efforts by delivering the "Seventh of March" compromise speech on the Senate floor, one of the most memorable speeches in American history; and John C.

Waugh</b> was a staff correspondant and bureau chief of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>. He is author of six books on the Civil War era, and served on the senior staffs of two national politicians, Nelson Rockefeller of New York and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico.A byzantine legislative package arising out of the squabble between North and South over the spoils of the Mexican War, the Compromise of 1850 admitted California as a free state, referred the explosive issue of slavery in the former Mexican territories to an ill-defined formula of "popular sovereignty," and instituted a harsh and bitterly divisive Fugitive Slave Law. Intended to settle sectional strife, the Compromise unraveled during the subsequent decade; it served mainly to map the fault lines that would split the country in the Civil War. The crisis receives an engaging exposition in this colorful study, part of the American Crisis Series focusing on the Civil War era. Journalist and historian Waugh (Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle for the 1864 Presidency) gives a lucid account of the interminable Congressional wrangling between Northern abolitionists, Southern secessionists and uneasy moderates of both sections, which grew so intense that at one point pistols were drawn on the Senate floor. He concentrates on the personalities and rhetoric of the main legislative protagonists, especially Henry Clay, John Calhoun and Daniel Webster, the Senatorial orators who dominated the nation's politics in the first half of the century by patching together one legislative fix after another to paper over the widening sectional divide. Waugh's book is something of an elegy to, and a subtle condemnation of, the era of patriotic compromise embodied by this "great trio," whose sonorous reverence for the Union and the Constitution proved so unequal to the moral issues posed by slavery.

Every toy and game has been tested by the Foxfire students and is devised to make or play yourself, without major expense, complicated parts, or electricity. <br><br>Originally published in 1985, the book includes familiar games like marbles, hopscotch, and horseshoes, as well as more obscure entertainments such as stealing the pines, crows and cranes, and thimble. Here, too, are instructions for constructing playhouses, noisemakers, puzzles, and whimmy diddles. The book also provides information on special games traditionally played on Sundays and holidays. <br><br>For those who are tired of worn-out batteries and electronic toys and for anyone curious about the playtimes of an earlier generation, <i>The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Toys and Games</i> is a welcome and entertaining guide.<br><br></p><p>"If you're interested in finding out what play time was like for children before the invention of Nintendo, you'll probably enjoy this book.

Having reluctantly acceded to his wife's wish for a house in the Catskills, Mullen turns his gimlet eye on rural New York, deconstructing the local practice of exchanging waves with all passing drivers and the coercive function of the local newspaper's hyper-detailed police blotter. Mullen is funniest at his most acerbic, like when he verbally eviscerates some pretentious houseguests: "Bert is wearing what he thinks are country clothes ostrich skin cowboy boots with silver tips... a skin-tight cowboy shirt.... He looks like Miss Kitty's pimp." Or in this description of "Walleye" 's town square: "A community college that looks as if it was designed by a cabal of the worst Soviet bloc architects... saves the town from being too cute for words." But he eventually goes native, respectfully acknowledging the locals' contempt of clueless, demanding weekend "flatlanders," and coming to appreciate the simpler life: "Why would... eating lunch at La Grenouille... be more important than watching the birds on the feeder?" he wonders. As the shticky title suggests, the book relies heavily on authorial invention; Mullen openly admits to "exaggerations, fictionalizations, and anachronisms." In the end, authors like Bill Bryson manage a more sustainable mix of solemnity and humor, but Mullen's readership and, yes, members of the trendy crowd looking for a little light weekend reading will find this rewarding enough.

However, since then, the idea of finding wisdom from philosophy has come to seem bizarre. Enter a university department today and ask to study wisdom, and you will politely but firmly be shown the door. The Consolations of Philosophy sets out to refute the notion that good philosophy must be irrelevant and gathers together six great philosophers who were convinced of the power of philosophical insight to work a practical effect on our lives. Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche are read for the light their work can shine on certain great universal problems, among them, unpopularity, poverty, inadequacy, lovelessness and timidity. The book amounts to a guide to wisdom - as well as to the practical utility of philosophy.</p><p></p><h2>Yuletide Homicide (A Wiccan Wheel Mystery)</h2><p><i>It&#x2019;s Christmas in Edindale, Illinois, and family law attorney Keli Milanni is preparing to celebrate the Wiccan holiday Yuletide, a celebration of rebirth.

Inside, on July 10, the White House National Security Team was celebrating a victory over the Senate Committee on Intelligence when the stranger appeared. The &#x201c;Protectors&#x201d; had overcome a 4&#x2013;1 deficit to win the division championship. Twelve sweaty men and women sat drinking cold draft beer and eating the pub&#x2019;s famed Diplomat Burgers, reliving the game. Their come-from-behind victory had been so satisfying that for once no one talked shop.</p><p>Nothing about this morning&#x2019;s raid by FBI agents in Miami, where a gun battle and explosion had destroyed a small home. Three &#x201c;foreign males,&#x201d; as neighbors described them, had rented the house, barricaded themselves inside, and blown themselves up rather than surrender. &#x201c;All evidence was obliterated,&#x201d; the FBI report said.</p><p>Nothing about jihadist branches popping up in South America. Or the U.S./China face-off in the South China Sea. Just softball and gossip, until the cute Thai waitress bent over and told Deputy Assistant National Secretary Advisor Kyle Utley that a man needed to speak to him, outside.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell him to come in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He says it is too noisy in here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d; Kyle asked, only half paying attention.</p><p>&#x201c;He says he has big news,&#x201d; the waitress said.</p><p>Kyle left his cell phone on the table&#x2014;mistake&#x2014;and walked out of the bar. On humid L Street waited a trim, white, neatly bearded stranger wearing a wide-brimmed red Nats cap, blue tennis shirt, and Adidas. Utley, a former Army Ranger, noted the lower end of a Special Forces tattoo on the right bicep: a coiled snake on a knife hilt. Above that, but hidden beneath the sleeve, would be the skull, beret, and snake head on the muscled arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry to interrupt the party,&#x201d; the stranger said, not looking that way at all. &#x201c;Nice home run in the seventh, by the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Kyle was irritated at the coy, I-know-things-you-don&#x2019;t attitude, and the fact that the guy had been watching him. He noted the southwestern twang, alert posture, and smile that did not reach the mud-colored eyes. The man&#x2019;s slim frame rose to wide shoulders. He radiated fitness.</p><p>&#x201c;Kyle, you have instant access to the President&#x2019;s Security Advisor. You&#x2019;re not important enough to have a bodyguard. Pass along a message, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What message?&#x201d; Utley asked, chilled despite the heat and understanding that a threat was coming. All threats&#x2014;he knew&#x2014;were to be taken seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;That slush fund you guys run out of Ankara, Turkey? To pay off friendly warlords across the border? We&#x2019;re going to kill several hundred Americans in seventy-two hours if your bosses don&#x2019;t divert that money. On this paper is a list of charities. Three hundred million dollars is not a lot. Imagine if a few hundred million would have averted the World Trade Center attack. That cost trillions and the bill keeps rising. Pay and everyone stays safe. Plus&#x201d;&#x2014;he winked&#x2014;&#x201c;it all stays secret, with the convention coming up. Hey, the money&#x2019;s there already! Easy access!&#x201d;</p><p>Utley stared into the eyes and saw intelligence and calm. His pulse had risen. His combat time in Afghanistan had destroyed any illusions about the depths of human violence. The stranger seemed rational, if that word could be applied to threats. Kyle eyed the paper and thin rubber gloves on the stranger, meaning no fingerprints.</p><p>&#x201c;You sound American,&#x201d; Utley said.</p><p>&#x201c;Then my language lessons were good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you have a gripe about something, let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the money for?&#x201d; Kyle asked, trying to delay, thinking, five foot ten, mid to late twenties, no visible scars, gap in the front teeth, three freckles on the right lower lip. He felt sweat on the back of his neck.</p><p>The man said, &#x201c;Consider the payments reparations for Tol-e-Khomri.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was that name again?&#x201d;</p><p>Darkness had fallen. Kyle had never heard of Tol-e-Khomri. A lone Volkswagen Jetta cruised past. Two wilted-looking National Geographic writers&#x2014;the only other people on the block&#x2014;brushed past, into the bar. Air-conditioning blasted out into the ninety-degree night.</p><p>Kyle held out the paper. &#x201c;These organizations are not charities. They&#x2019;re fronts for terrorists.&#x201d;</p><p>The man smiled. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t possibly be right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll stop making demands if you get the money?&#x201d; Utley said, not negotiating, just trying to keep the man there while he took mental notes, figured out what to do.</p><p>&#x201c;Give us what we want and we go somewhere else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What exactly will happen if we don&#x2019;t pay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something terrible and unprecedented. Bombs, but not bombs. Panic, but no one will understand at first. It will occur in three cities. It will turn your world upside down. When America learns this warning was ignored, there will be consequences for your bosses. The third coming of wrath.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not being clear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201d;</p><p>The man shrugged. &#x201c;Then wait seventy-two hours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How about if I call someone more senior than me.&#x201d; Kyle gathered himself to attack. He&#x2019;d been trained in close combat, but that was years ago. These days he didn&#x2019;t even have time to work out in a gym. He said, changing stance so he could move fast, &#x201c;This is not my area and I&#x2019;m sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; the man hissed.</p><p>He&#x2019;d stepped back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m faster than you, Kyle. You&#x2019;ve been out of the service awhile. Just call your boss. That&#x2019;s all you have to do. Then your part is over.&#x201d;</p><p>The man smiled. What could be easier? he seemed to suggest. Left-winger? Right? Veteran who had suffered some injury and blamed the government? Kyle had been schooled in what to say if a threat ever came, although the lessons had always assumed a phone call, not a personal confrontation. Try to control the situation. What a laugh. He might as well try to fly.</p><p>The man said, &#x201c;On 9/11 you had no warning. This time you have a choice.&#x201d; He turned and limped briskly up the block toward 15th. Utley began to follow. The man spun and raised an index finger. Kyle halted.</p><p>Kyle watched the man disappear around the corner. Kyle went to the corner. Somehow, the man was gone. That he could disappear so fast made his threat seem more real.</p><p>Kyle went back into the pub, where his teammates realized from his expression that something bad had happened. He retrieved his phone, walked back outside, and punched in the emergency number for the President&#x2019;s National Security Advisor, who picked up immediately. He was at a barbecue in Potomac. Kyle heard men and women laughing in the background. Someone had made a joke.</p><p>&#x201c;A nut,&#x201d; the National Security Advisor said, after hearing the story, but they both knew this was hope, not analysis.</p><p>After a beat, the NSA asked, &#x201c;He actually said Tol-e-Khomri? Those exact words?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Tol-e-Khomri?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind. Special Forces, you say? An American?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He had the tattoo. But anyone could have that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He knew about the special fund, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, everyone over there knows. It&#x2019;s the worst-kept secret in the Mideast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s never been a situation where someone just walked up and made a threat outside a bar. And bombastic rhetoric is par for the course. They talk big. They bluff.&#x201d;</p><p>An hour later Kyle was at the barbecue, too, at the home of the White House Chief of Staff, on the patio, where a strategy session&#x2014;how to handle soft-on-terror charges before the national political convention&#x2014;had just been interrupted. He recounted the story, ice cubes melting in the tumbler of Maker&#x2019;s Mark in his hand.</p><p>By midnight, the heads of all major security agencies were on a conference call with the President, answering questions about ongoing alerts. There were no specific threats being investigated at this time. The three terrorists in Miami were dead. Nothing alarming intercepted over the past few days on monitored phone or e-mails. No particularly important national events scheduled within the next seventy-two hours. They tried to figure out what &#x201c;bombs, but not bombs&#x201d; meant.</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said, someone wants to rattle us. If they really had something, they wouldn&#x2019;t give us a heads-up,&#x201d; said the head of the CIA.</p><p>&#x201c;The third coming of wrath? Churchill called the nuclear bomb the second. What&#x2019;s the third?&#x201d; That from the FBI.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty damn confident, bragging that they&#x2019;re here already. Usually they claim credit after,&#x201d; Kyle fretted.</p><p>&#x201c;The Tol-e-Khomri reference bothers me the most,&#x201d; the National Security Advisor said.</p><p>The decision was not to pay, of course, or announce a potential threat days before the national political convention, but relevant agencies would try to track all spending by the &#x201c;charities&#x201d; overseas, even though the guess was, money trails would be dead ends, a traceless series of transfers, cash disappearing into black holes.</p><p>The national terrorism threat level was raised to red that night, but Homeland Security announced it was a drill. Police around the country increased patrols around public facilities. Army Reserve copters flew over major harbors. Homeland Security added staff at airports. The cost drained hundreds of millions of dollars, as usual.</p><p>Another drill.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t bow to threats,&#x201d; the National Security Advisor told Kyle boldly, after the meeting.</p><p>We just did, he thought, at home on Calvert Street, unable to sleep. The seventy-two-hour deadline had shrunk to sixty-six. He had not told his wife what happened. On TV, sound off to let her sleep, he watched a firefight between U.S. Rangers and ISIS troops. Then came a segment about veterans being mistreated in VA hospitals. Is it about this? Utley wondered, each time the announcer detailed another gripe.</p><p>At that moment Amtrak&#x2019;s regularly scheduled Patriot Express pulled into Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and the fourth man who exited the quiet car no longer looked as he had at the New Post Pub. The blond wig was gone. The hair was short, thick, black, and curly. The limp was absent, the tattoo and freckles washed off. The man stood just on the tall side of average. The face, without beard or cheek plugs, seemed rounder, and the eyes, contact lenses out, were almost azure blue, with a slight bulge that made him look less intelligent. The look was deceptive.</p><p>Tom Fargo transferred to the New York City subway Two train, heading south, downtown. Even at this hour people were moving around the great city. College boys coming back from having sex with girlfriends. Pissed-off Yankees fans who had closed a Chelsea bar after the fiasco with the Red Sox tonight. A homeless man who snored and stank of urine. A Japanese tourist, too shy to ask directions. Any of them, Tom speculated, might be dead by next week, and the subway filled with panic-stricken people trying to flee the metropolis any way they could.</p><p>Tom Fargo looked around the car and hated these people with a vast, steady drumbeat that pulsed through his veins. You are of them but not one of them, Dr. Cardozo had said. He had fought them overseas, in dry wadis and wet melon fields. He&#x2019;d assassinated an American diplomat in a Rio shopping mall. Now he was back home.</p><p>The subway rocked, and he smelled cologne and garlicky sweat, French fries and cleaned-away vomit. These people lived in filth. They were so fat that they actually paid others to help them become thin, the natural hungry state of millions elsewhere. Their armies slaughtered while they occupied themselves with subway advertisements to cure toenail fungus. These people were as oblivious as the old fool who had taught him what to do tonight.</p><p>When you make a threat, Hobart Haines had told him, long ago, you need to back it up with action. Hook them with easy cooperation. Then nail them to the wall.</p><p>Tom Fargo was not afraid. Running over what was to happen next, he recalled that before boarding Amtrak he&#x2019;d made a phone call from outside Union Station, used an encrypted cell, punched in a twenty-digit number, and the signal had joined a hundred thousand other calls shot gunning into space at that moment, to bounce off a commercial satellite in a flood of talk that overwhelmed monitoring. Even if listeners broke the encryption, which was virtually impossible, he spoke in code. He and Dr. Cardozo traded comments about soccer. Hundreds of miles above earth, words lived, money moved, plans coalesced. Their coded words had meant:</p><p>&#x201c;Think they&#x2019;ll go for it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Makes no difference. We do the same either way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your suggestions were smart, Tom. You suggested sending two separate groups to America. You said to make the demands first, not after. You know how to talk to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a good teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>At Brooklyn Borough Hall, Tom Fargo exited the train and walked up top and into an area housing century-old municipal buildings. He headed toward Brooklyn Heights. The night was sultry, the air so saturated with moisture that a light mist coated cars, the hulking courthouse, a neon-smeared falafel shop window. The city smelled of baking tar, coal oven pizza, hundred-year-old brick, diesel fuel. At 3:45 a.m. even the muggers were asleep. The neighborhood was a high-income area filled with young professionals. His rented co-op was in a converted potato chip factory, across from the Brooklyn Bridge, down the cobblestone street from the popular River Cafï¿½.</p><p>Tom Fargo pushed through a polished glass revolving door to enter the sparkling lobby, where the night doorman sat behind a large post, eyeing a portable TV, on which a White House spokesman was telling a news announcer, &#x201c;The President has kept us safe for four years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, sir,&#x201d; the doorman said.</p><p>&#x201c;Call me Tom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Been clubbing again in Manhattan?&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Fargo grinned and rubbed his thick hair as if happily woozy from drink. &#x201c;The shop doesn&#x2019;t open until noon. Might as well have some fun before that.&#x201d;</p><p>The doorman sat beneath a framed black-and-white 1950s photo of Christmas shoppers on 5th Avenue: sleekly dressed executives, upscale tourists, wealthy leisure seekers. The shot caught the casual power and confidence at the heart of a great empire. People who knew they were safe. But Tom knew that within days the looks on those faces would change. It was too late to stop his first attack. He&#x2019;d set it in motion before going to Washington. There was no way the Americans would capitulate to demands at this stage without proof.</p><p>The doorman was a forty-year-old Dominican, nine years in the union. He lowered his voice, as if to reveal a secret. He was a tall man with a tough face and sensitive disposition. He wrote poetry lyrics late at night, and listened to biographies of singing stars on DVDs.</p><p>&#x201c;It happened again, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Fargo stiffened.</p><p>&#x201c;She came down to walk the dog. Her face, sir. It was black and blue. It&#x2019;s not right.&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Fargo relaxed, because this wasn&#x2019;t about the FBI. But he was angry. The doorman was hoping Tom would call the cops on his next-door neighbor, a big, loudmouthed architect who chaired the building co-op board and relished his nickname, &#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; and lived with...</p></p><h2>Wyoming Cowboy Ranger (Carsons &amp; Delaneys: Battle Tested, 3)</h2><p><strong>He reminds her of a past she&#x2019;s spent a long time trying to forget...</strong><br><br>Jen Delaney kept her romance with Tyler Carson secret&#x2014;along with her broken heart after he left Bent.

Tour.</p><p>Dr. Lonnie Barbach received her M.A. and Ph.D. in clinical social psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley, California. She is now on the clinical faculty of the University of California Medical School in San Francisco and also has a private practice. Among her several bestselling books on sex and relationships are <b>For Yourself, Pleasures, Going the Distance, The Pause, Seductions, The Erotic Edge</b>, and <b>Erotic Interludes</b>, her book with her partner, David Geisinger, Ph.D. They live in Mill Valley, California, with their daughter, Tess.An anthology of 22 erotic short stories selected by psychologist Barbach, whose interests in monogamy and women's sexuality come together in this book designed to help monogamous couples enhance their sex lives. The present collection differs from Barbach's earlier ones (Erotic Interludes, 1986, etc.) in that those were written by women for women, while this one is intended for both sexes. An interesting difference in male and female erotic writing styles soon becomes apparent: Stories written by men tend to be more visual and explicit, while those by women tend to emphasize feelings and the total relationship. The volume is divided into three parts, each with an introduction by Barbach. The tales in Part One, each with a distinctively male or female flavor, have varied themes: sex with a ghost, acting out fantasies, group sex, seduction. Part Two features three themes: unrequited love (a favorite with women), anonymous sex (more popular with men), and sexual affairs (both sexes write about this but handle it differently). Stories in the third section were written by couples, thus each event is seen from both a male and a female perspective. According to Barbach, who calls this final part ``The Perfect Match,'' these tales illustrate the dramatic variety of successful sexual relationships. She suggests that the stories be read as an aphrodisiac before or during lovemaking, and that solitary readers can use them as a substitute for an absent lover. For best effects, use sparingly. A surfeit of supple mouths, jutting nipples, and bare buttocks begins to pall, and when the erotic value of these tales fades, there's not much left to recommend them. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in Los Angeles.Though this work is based in a true story, the subject matter here is not far afield from Cooper's past fiction ( Wrong, LJ 5/15/92; Frisk , Grove 1991). An accomplice to early-Seventies serial killer Dean Corll, David Brooks alternates his catharsis-on-tour puppet show with confessional essays. Both are deadpan descriptions of his last days with Corll and fellow accomplice Wayne Henley. The book closes with a term paper written by a student analyzing this play/reading, seen with his psychology class earlier in the term. The various narators' voices are finely tuned, and the contrast of overwrought prose with banal observation in the closing essay is perfectly executed. Jerk adroitly raises anew questions about the boundaries of fiction, nonfiction, and criticism while remaining an engrossing story. Included are ten photos of conceptual artist Nayland Blake's puppets, which inspired this novella. Cooper's most complex and complete work yet belongs in all literary fiction collections; while large contemporary art collections should consider for Blake's work. --Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Skinner&#39;s Mission (Bob Skinner)</h2><p><p>Skinner must help a criminal in order to catch a killer, in this sixth novel in the bestselling Edinburgh crime series. </p><p>When an Edinburgh car showroom is torched, leaving a charred body among the burnt-out luxury cars, Deputy Chief Constable Bob Skinner wonders if a life of crime has finally caught up with one of the city's most elusive villains.

The leader of this improbable mission is Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, the oldest lieutenant commander in the navy, whose career thus far had been distinguished by two sinkings. His seemingly impossible charge: to trek overland through the African bush hauling <i>Mimi</i> and <i>Toutou</i>&#x2013;two forty-foot mahogany gunboats&#x2013;and defeat the Germans on Lake Tanganyika. Spicer-Simson sets forth on a lunatic 2,800-mile journey with a band of cantankerous, insubordinate Scotsmen, Irishmen and Englishmen. After going into battle wearing a skirt and becoming the god of an African tribe by showing them his tattoos, he is acclaimed a hero. But the truth about the battle is somewhat more complex.<br><br>With its powerfully evoked landscape, cast of hilariously colorful characters and remarkable story of hubris, ingenuity and perseverance, <i>Mimi and Toutou&#x2019;s Big Adventure </i>is history at its most entertaining and absorbing.</p><p>Giles Foden was born in England in 1967 and grew up in Africa.

It is entirely possible that the retired petty-officer doorman paid little attention to the guest who arrived on 21 April 1915. There were, after all, more important matters for a retired petty-officer doorman to consider; not least the recent departure from the Admiralty of the two dynamic but headstrong individuals who had run the place. Namely, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill and the First Sea Lord Admiral Fisher. They had clashed bitterly over the military fiasco of the Gallipoli campaign. Both were great men; both had fallen because of Churchill&#x2019;s plan to cut short the War with an invasion of western Turkey.<br><br>The visitor was tanned and fit and wore civilian clothes, but otherwise there was nothing remarkable about him. His profession sounded glamorous, however. He was a big-game hunter from Africa and he had an appointment to see the new First Sea Lord, Sir Henry Jackson.<br><br>The story the hunter told would set in train some of the strangest events of the First World War. Their conclusion would make famous&#x2014;for a while, at least&#x2014;the navy&#x2019;s most quixotic character since the days of the privateers. Like the hand-made cigarettes he commissioned, his personality was a particular mixture: one that involved as much cowardice as heroism, as much self-regard as self-belief.<br><br>This individual&#x2019;s name&#x2014;inscribed in pale blue on those hand-made cigarettes&#x2014;was Geoffrey Spicer-Simson and he held the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was based in the Admiralty when the hunter paid his visit. The doorman would have known this, because the doormen of Whitehall know everything about the workings of government&#x2014;especially in wartime, the only time when the Whitehall machine works properly. He would have known that Spicer-Simson sat in no great splendour in a barely furnished office somewhere high up in the building.<br><br>High up geographically, that is, because Spicer-Simson was actually in disgrace. And there was a good reason&#x2014;several good reasons, in fact&#x2014;why a trained naval commander had spent the first eight months of the War in a dusty office containing two chairs, two desks piled with papers and little else, except a stone fireplace without a fire.<br><br>Born in Tasmania in 1876, Geoffrey Basil Spicer-Simson was one of five children. Formerly in the merchant navy, their father Frederick Simson was a dealer in gold sovereigns in India who eventually settled in Le Havre, France, at the age of thirty-one. There he met eighteen-year-old Dora Spicer, daughter of a visiting English clergyman,* and on marrying changed his name to Spicer-Simson. In 1874 they moved to Tasmania, having some family there, and ran a sheep farm for five years. Dora didn&#x2019;t care for the colonial life, however, and in 1879 they returned to France. The children were sent to schools in England. The eldest, Theodore, became an artist, moving between France and the United States. The youngest, Noel, eventually joined the British army.<br><br>Geoffrey Spicer-Simson entered the Royal Navy at the age of fourteen, embarking on what for a considerable time would be a disastrous career. This was partly due to the eccentricities of his character. Boastful and vain-glorious, by the time war was declared he was well known throughout the officer corps. They generally avoided him. One reason for this was that he took every opportunity to show off his arms and upper torso, which were heavily tattooed with depictions of snakes and butterflies. He liked to brag, too, about his individual bravery in many dangerous adventures. Recounted with a distant, rhapsodic look, most of these tales were lies.<br><br>An expert on every subject (even in the presence of genuine experts), Spicer also enjoyed telling jokes (nobody laughed at them) and singing (he was invariably off-key). It is not surprising that his fellow officers thought of him as at best peculiar, at worst downright dangerous. It didn&#x2019;t help that he spoke in a curious manner. Nor that he tended to swagger and throw his weight around. In his groundbreaking history The Great War in Africa (1987), Byron Farwell describes Spicer as &#x201c;a large, muscular, round-shouldered man with thin, close-cropped hair, a Vandyke beard, and light grey eyes, he affected a nasal drawl . . . He indulged in a proclivity for browbeating waiters and others serving on lower rungs of life than his own.&#x201d;<br><br>Spicer had always wanted to be a hero. After joining the training ship Britannia in 1890 as a cadet, he advanced some way through the ranks, serving in the Gambia and on the China Station, where he made the first hydrographic survey of the Yangtse River. But a series of bumbling errors and catastrophic misjudgements had left him stuck in the naval hierarchy, the oldest lieutenant commander in the navy.<br><br>There was, for example, that time during the Channel manoeuvres of 1905 when he suggested it would be a good idea for two destroyers to drag a line strung from one to the other in a periscope-hunting exercise. He nearly sank a submarine. Or there was the time when, in an exercise intended to test the defences of Portsmouth Harbour, he drove his ship onto a nearby beach. He was court-martialled for that.<br><br>He was also court-martialled for sinking a liberty boat in a collision, after smashing his destroyer into it. Someone was killed. The incident was reported in the local papers. Lieutenant Commander Spicer-Simson had something of a reputation for disaster.<br><br>In August 1914, at the start of the War, Spicer was put in charge of a coastal flotilla consisting of two gunboats and six boarding tugs operating out of Ramsgate. He felt confident enough of the anchorage of his gunboats to come onshore and entertain his wife and some lady friends in a hotel. He could see HMS Niger, one of the ships in question, well enough from the window, could he not?<br><br>Fate answered this question with a resounding Yes.<br><br>Yes, from the window of the hotel bar Spicer could see Niger as the Germans torpedoed her. He could watch her sink, too, in just twenty minutes. And going down with her, he could see his hopes of advancement to the highest echelon of the navy disappear beneath the waves.<br><br>Such was the state of Spicer&#x2019;s fortunes on 21 April 1915 when a big-game hunter called John Lee arrived at the Admiralty with an appointment to see the new First Sea Lord, Sir Henry Jackson. Lee had great experience of Lake Tanganyika. He also had a scheme to bring it under British control. Britain had no ships on the lake and it was not an area Sir Henry knew anything about, so he was happy to listen to Lee&#x2019;s plan and called for a map.<br><br>How did the War stand in April 1915 on the &#x201c;forgotten front&#x201d;? The conflict on the plains, lakes and mountains of Central and East Africa had almost slipped from the mind of the British authorities. On a wooden chart table at the offices of the First Sea Lord at Admiralty House, Whitehall, Lee showed Sir Henry the lie of the land . . .<br><br>Here was German East Africa, comprising the present territory of Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. Here were Kenya and Uganda, under British control. So too were the Rhodesias Northern and Southern (now Zambia and Zimbabwe respectively). Further down was South Africa, which was British&#x2014;though some of the Boers with whom Britain had fought a war between 1899 and 1902 could not be trusted. The South Africans had invaded German South West Africa (now Namibia) at the start of the War. Superior in numbers, by September 1914 the British South Africans had more or less overrun the South-west German territory, though a pro-German rebellion by Boer officers rumbled on until February 1915.<br><br>The Germans had more success in East Africa, mainly thanks to their force of Schï¿½tztruppen. These highly trained units of German officers and African askaris respected their commander, a military genius called Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. In November 1914 he had repelled a British landing of troops from India at the northern Tanganyikan port of Tanga. This was &#x201c;a major setback for British ambitions in east Africa,&#x201d; as Ross Anderson notes in his 2002 study of the battle&#x2014;and it left many British guns and other supplies in von Lettow&#x2019;s hands. Another problem was the continuing existence of a big German cruiser called the Kï¿½nigsberg, which was hidden in the swamps of the Rufiji delta farther south near Dar es Salaam, the capital of German East Africa.<br><br>If we compare the German army marching into Belgium at the start of the War with the African experience a year or so later, we get a sense of how utterly different were the two theatres of conflict. Here is journalist Richard Harding Davis describing the Germans entering Brussels, mesmerised by their massed grey uniforms:<br><br>It is a grey-green . . . the grey of the hour just before daybreak, the grey of unpolished steel, of mist among green trees. I saw it first in the Grande Place in front of the Hï¿½tel de Ville. It was impossible to tell if in that noble square there was a regiment or a brigade. You saw only a fog that melted into the stones, blended with the ancient house fronts, that shifted and drifted, but left nothing at which you could point.<br><br>It was, Davis adds, &#x201c;typical of the German staff striving for efficiency to leave nothing to chance.&#x201d;<br><br>In Africa, by contrast, von Lettow&#x2019;s Schï¿½tztruppen&#x2014;cut off by British naval power from German supply lines&#x2014;quickly became a raggedy, make-do outfit that depended on chance and thrived on opportunism. Motor fuel was improvised from cocoa; quinine was brewed from the barks of trees; ammunition was captured from the British. Hippopotamus were shot for their meat and fat, the latter being used to make candles and soap.

Tarzan's courtship of the female ape Teeka ends in failure when her preference turns to their mutual friend, the male ape Taug. Tarzan wrestles with his humanness versus his ape-ness. The allusion to Helen of Troy enriches the story, making Tarzan and Taug's fight over Teeka take on symbolic proportions. Stan Galloway writes: "when Burroughs chooses to name Helen as an objective correlative for Teeka, he expects both literal and emotional connections to occur."Tarzan's final claim of the story -- "Tarzan is a man. He will go alone."&#x2014;echoes the plight of Adam in the Garden of Eden.</p><p>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and library bound.

Alvar Olsen was blathering on about something, gesticulating wildly and waving a set of papers. But Salander could not hear a word he said. It was 7:30 p.m.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the most dangerous time at Flodberga Prison. Seven-thirty p.m. was when the daily freight train thundered past; the walls shook and keys rattled and the place smelled of sweat and perfume. All the worst abuses took place then, masked by the racket from the railway and in the general confusion just before the cell doors were shut. Salander always let her gaze wander back and forth over the unit at this time of day and it was probably no coincidence that she caught sight of Faria Kazi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Faria was young and beautiful, from Bangladesh, and she was sitting in her cell. From where Salander and Olsen stood, all Salander could see was her face. Someone was slapping Faria. Her head kept jerking from side to side, though the blows were not that hard&#x2014;there was something almost routine about them. It was clear from Faria&#x2019;s humiliated expression that the abuse had been going on for a long time and had broken her will to resist.<br> &nbsp;<br> No hands were raised to try to stop the slapping, and in Faria&#x2019;s eyes&nbsp;there was no indication of surprise, only a mute, dull fear. This terror was part of her life. Salander could see that just by studying her face, and it matched what she had observed during her weeks at the prison.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will you look at that,&#x201d; she said, pointing into Faria&#x2019;s cell.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But by the time Olsen had turned to look, it was over. Salander disappeared into her own cell and closed the door. She could hear voices and muffled laughter in the corridor and outside the freight train clanging by, shaking the walls. She stood in front of the shiny washbasin and narrow bed, the bookshelf and desk strewn with pages of her quantum mechanical calculations. Did she feel like doing more work on loop quantum gravity theory? She realized she was holding something and looked down at her hand.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the same sheaf of papers that Olsen had been waving around, and that did, after all, make her a little curious. But it was some sort of rubbish with coffee cup rings all over the cover page: an intelligence test. Ridiculous. She hated to be prodded and measured.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She dropped the papers which spread like a fan on the concrete floor. For a brief moment they vanished from her mind as her thoughts went back to Faria Kazi. Salander had not seen who was hitting her. But she knew perfectly well who it was. Although at first prison life had not interested Salander, reluctantly she had been drawn in, decoding the visible and invisible signals one by one. By now she understood who called the shots.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This was called the B Unit, the secure section. It was considered the safest place in the institution, and to a visitor that might have been how it seemed. There were more guards, more controls and more rehabilitation programmes here than anywhere else in the prison. But anyone who took a closer look would realize there was something rotten about the place. The guards put on an act, exuding authority, and they even pretended to care. But in fact they were cowards who had lost control, and they had ceded power to their chief antagonists, gang leader Benito Andersson and her mob.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> During the day Benito kept a low profile and behaved like a model prisoner, but after the evening meal, when the inmates could exercise or&nbsp;receive visits, she took over. At this time of day her reign of terror was uncontested, just before the doors were locked for the night. As the prisoners roamed between cells, making threats and promises in whispered tones, Benito&#x2019;s gang kept to one side, their victims to the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact that Salander was in prison at all was a major scandal. But circumstances had hardly been on her side, nor had she put up a very convincing fight. The interlude seemed absurd to her, but she also thought she might just as well be in jail as anywhere else.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had been sentenced to two months for unlawful use of property and reckless endangerment in the dramatic events following the murder of Professor Frans Balder. Salander had taken it upon herself to hide his eight-year-old autistic son and refused to cooperate with the police because she believed&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;that the police investigation had been betrayed. No-one disputed that she went to heroic lengths to save the child&#x2019;s life. Even so, Chief Prosecutor Richard Ekstrï¿½m led the case with great conviction, and the court ultimately found against her, although one of the lay judges dissented. Salander&#x2019;s lawyer, Annika Giannini, had done an outstanding job. But she got virtually no help from her client, so that in the end Salander did not stand a chance. She maintained a sullen silence throughout the trial and refused to appeal the verdict. She simply wanted to get the business over with.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first she was sent to Bjï¿½rngï¿½rda Gï¿½rd open prison, where she had a lot of freedom. Then new information surfaced, suggesting there were people who wanted to harm her. This was not entirely unexpected, given the enemies she had made, so she was transferred to the secure wing at Flodberga.<br> &nbsp;<br> Salander had no problem sharing space with Sweden&#x2019;s most notorious female criminals. She was constantly surrounded by guards, and no assaults or violence had been reported in the unit for many years. Records also showed that an impressive number of inmates had been rehabilitated. But those statistics all came from the time before the arrival of Benito Andersson.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> From the day Salander arrived at the prison, she faced a variety of provocations. She was a high-profile prisoner known from media coverage, not to mention the rumours that spread through the underworld. Only a few days earlier, Benito had put a note in her hand which read: friend or enemy? Salander had thrown it away after a minute&#x2014;it took about fifty-eight seconds before she could be bothered to read it.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She had no interest in power struggles or alliances. She concentrated on observing and learning, and by now she felt she had learned more than enough. She stared blankly at her bookshelf, stocked with the essays on quantum field theory she had ordered before she landed inside. In the cupboard on the left were two changes of prison clothes, all stamped with the initials of the prison service, plus some underwear and two pairs of sneakers. There was nothing on the walls, not a single reminder of life on the outside. She cared no more for the surroundings in her cell than those in her home on Fiskargatan.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cell doors were being shut along the corridor and normally that meant some freedom for Salander. When the noise died down, she could lose herself in mathematics&#x2014;in attempts to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity&#x2014;and forget the world around her. But tonight was different. She was irritated, and not just because of the abuse of Faria Kazi or the rampant corruption in the unit.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She could not stop thinking about the visit six days earlier from Holger Palmgren, her old guardian from the time when the authorities had decided she was incapable of taking care of herself. The visit had been a major production. Palmgren was entirely dependent on home aides and assistants and hardly ever left his apartment in Liljeholmen. But he had been adamant. The social service&#x2019;s subsidized transport service brought him in his wheelchair, as he wheezed into an oxygen mask. Salander was glad to see him.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She and Palmgren had spoken of old times and he had become sentimental and emotional. There was just one thing that troubled Salander. Palmgren told her that a woman by the name of Maj-Britt Torell had&nbsp;been to see him. She used to be a secretary at St. Stefan&#x2019;s psychiatric clinic for children, where Salander had been a patient. The woman had read about Salander in the newspapers and brought Palmgren some documents which she believed he might find interesting. According to Palmgren it was more of the same old horror stories about how Salander had been strapped to her bed in the clinic and subjected to the worst kind of psychological abuse. &#x201c;Nothing you need to see,&#x201d; he said. Still, something must have stood out, because when Palmgren asked about her dragon tattoo and the woman with the birthmark, he said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she from the Registry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Registry for the Study of Genetics and Social Environment in Uppsala? I thought I read that somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The name must have been in those new documents,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think so? Perhaps I&#x2019;m just muddling it all up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps he was. Palmgren had grown old. Yet the information stuck in Salander&#x2019;s mind. It had gnawed at her while she trained on the speedball in the gym in the afternoons and worked in the ceramics workshop in the mornings. It gnawed away at her now as she stood in her cell looking down at the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow the I.Q. test which lay spread across the concrete no longer seemed irrelevant, but rather a continuation of her conversation with Palmgren. For a moment Salander could not grasp why. Then she remembered that the woman with the birthmark had given her all kinds of tests in those days. They always ended in arguments and eventually with Salander, at the age of just six, escaping into the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet what was most striking about these memories was not the tests or her running away, but the growing suspicion that there was something fundamental about her childhood she did not understand. She knew she had to find out more.<br> &nbsp;<br> True, she would soon be outside again and free to do as she wanted. But she also knew she had leverage with Warden Olsen. This was not the first time he had chosen to turn a blind eye to abuses, and the unit he headed, still a source of pride in the prison service, was in a state of moral&nbsp;decay. Salander guessed she could get Olsen to give her access to something no-one else in the prison was allowed&#x2014;an Internet connection.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She listened for sounds in the corridor. Muttered curses could be heard, along with doors being slammed, keys rattling and footsteps tapping off into the distance. Then silence fell. The only noise came from the ventilation system. It was broken&#x2014;the air was stifling, unbearable&#x2014;but still humming away. Salander looked at the papers on the floor and thought about Benito, Faria Kazi and Alvar Olsen&#x2014;and the woman with the fiery birthmark on her throat.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She bent to pick up the test, sat down at the desk and scribbled out some answers. Then she pressed the intercom button by the steel door. Olsen picked up after a long interval, sounding nervous. She said she needed to talk to him right away.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>Season in Hell &amp; Other Poems (English and French Edition)</h2><p><i>A Season in Hell </i>is one of the great works of modern literature. It is published here in a bilingual edition together with many of the verse poems which Rimbaud wrote between March 1870 and August 1872. <i>A Season in Hell </i>was Rimbaud's literary testament, his apology and a contribution to the mythology of his time.&nbsp;Norman Cameron (1905-53) was born in India and educated at Fettes College and Oriel College, Cambridge. He worked as a superintendent of Education in Nigeria, before becoming an advertising copywriter in London. During the 1930s he was a frequent contributor to Geoffrey Grigson's <i>New Verse</i>.&nbsp;He was awarded an MBE for his propaganda work during the war, and served with British forces in Austria until 1947, when he returned to London and advertising. In addition to his translations of Rimbaud, he published several collections of poetry including <i>The Winter House</i> (1935) and <i>Work in Hand </i>(1942). His <i>Collected Poems</i> (edited by Warren Hope and Jonathan Barker) was published by Anvil in 1990.</p><p>One of the most important modern European poets, <b>Rimbaud</b> was born in 1854 and wrote all his poetry before he had reached the age of 20. He then embarked on a somewhat peripatetic existence before cancer of the leg ended his life in 1891, aged just 37.<br><br> <b>Norman Cameron </b>(1905-1953) was born in India and educated at Fettes College and Oriel College, Cambridge. His <i>Collected Poems</i> was published by Anvil in 1990.&#39;Norman Cameron published two collections of translations from the work of the French poet Rimbaud during his lifetime. These have been brought together and they seem to me to provide a touchstone of what poetic translation is all about. Cameron never inserts his own personality between the reader and the text. Instead he puts all his skill as a poet at Rimbaud&#39;s service, with astonishing results. This is a bilingual edition so that on page after page one can see the alchemy of Rimbaud&#39;s words mirrored in English gold. If there has been a finer translation of any poet this century then I do not know it. Perhaps the secret lies in Cameron&#39;s own poetic practice: he wrote poems only when he felt compelled to do so by having that to say which could be said in no other way, and he seems to have recognised and captured a similar impress of necessity in Rimbaud. These versions were made for love and it shows&#39; - Robert Nye, The Times</p><h2>The Invasion of Canada: 1812-1813</h2><p>To America's leaders in 1812, an invasion of Canada seemed to be "a mere matter of marching," as Thomas Jefferson confidently predicted. How could a nation of 8 million fail to subdue a struggling colony of 300,000? Yet, when the campaign of 1812 ended, the only Americans left on Canadian soil were prisoners of war. Three American armies had been forced to surrender, and the British were in control of all of Michigan Territory and much of Indiana and Ohio.<br><br>In this remarkable account of the war's first year and the events that led up to it, Pierre Berton transforms history into an engrossing narrative that reads like a fast-paced novel. Drawing on personal memoirs and diaries as well as official dispatches, the author has been able to get inside the characters of the men who fought the war &#x2014; the common soldiers as well as the generals, the bureaucrats and the profiteers, the traitors and the loyalists.<br><br>Berton believes that if there had been no war, most of Ontario would probably be American today; and if the war had been lost by the British, all of Canada would now be part of the United States. But the War of 1812, or more properly the <i>myth</i> of the war, served to give the new settlers a sense of community and set them on a different course from that of their neighbours.</p><p>"If history could be taught in the schools the way Berton writes about it, there wouldn't be a more popular subject on the curriculum." &#x2014;<i>The Globe and Mail<br><br></i>"A wonderful historical work...a book of love, ambition, guile, heroism, tragedy and cowardice." &#x2014;<i>The Detroit News</i><br><br>"...a popular history as it should be written." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i>Pierre Berton was one of Canada&#x2019;s most popular and prolific authors.<b> </b>From narrative histories and popular culture, to picture and coffee table books to anthologies, to stories for children to readable, historical works for youth, many of his fifty books are now Canadian classics. <br><br>Born in 1920 and raised in the Yukon, Pierre Berton worked in Klondike mining camps during his university years. He spent four years in the army, rising from private to captain/instructor at the Royal Military College in Kingston. He spent his early newspaper career in Vancouver, where at 21 he was the youngest city editor on any Canadian daily. He wrote columns for and was editor of <i>Maclean&#x2019;s </i>magazine, appeared on CBC&#x2019;s public affairs program &#x201c;Close-Up&#x201d; and was a permanent fixture on &#x201c;Front Page Challenge&#x201d; for 39 years.

Its thorough scholarship does not in the least impede, but rather facilitates, its readability. It is masterly without being didactic.<br>No historical figure of eighteenth-century England has been more grossly misrepresented than the inventor of our favorite fast food. The stereotype is well known: an unscrupulous man of pleasure whose mistress, a courtesan, was murdered on the steps of the Admiralty, inside which her lover was carelessly mismanaging the War of American Independence.<br>It is refreshing to read a biography that explodes this long-accepted view. Martha Ray was not a courtesan but rather the Joan Sutherland of her day, whose rendering of "I know that my Redeemer liveth" was admired by the most discriminating critics. It was, appropriately, outside Covent Garden after attending a performance (not outside the Admiralty) that she was murdered by an unhinged admirer; she had lived for many years with and had borne children to John, fourth Earl of Sandwich. As to his mismanagement of naval affairs, Nicholas Rodger, the outstanding historian of the eighteenth-century navy, demonstrates in this brilliant and extremely readable book that as First Lord of the Admiralty he was in a class by himself.<br>This was by no means his only distinction. As a diplomat he displayed extraordinary powers and won from foreign statesmen the admiration and trust that his own countrymen then and subsequently have largely denied him. As a parliamentary manager of the constituencies that he was in a position to influence, he shared an energy, skill and wonderful tact in handling all sorts and conditions of men - qualities that were acknowledged and praised by his most unrelenting denigrators. As a young man he had been an adventurous traveler with a title to a place in the history of Greek epigraphy. His lifelong passion for music, especially in championing and reviving the then-unfashionable oratorios of Handel, has given him, in the present biographer's opinion, his nearest connection to the life of our own time.<br>For it is the special pleasure of this absorbing book that though it is written by one of England's foremost naval historians, it is not in the least restricted to the dockyards and the quarterdecks of the Georgian navy. The political analysis is subtle, original, and well argued. The intellectual and artistic background is part of a strikingly new view of the tall, lounging figure that surveys us from Gainsborough's great portrait now in the Maritime Museum. Above all, the human quality of a man whose domestic life was blighted by the madness of a dearly loved wife is brought before us.</p><p>Brilliantly written account of the 18th-century nobleman was a key player in British naval strategy during the War of Independence--and who invented our favorite fast food. The fourth Earl of Sandwich (1718-92) is usually written off as the archetypal wicked aristocrat: a self-seeker who neglected his country's interest in the pursuit of the pleasures of the bedroom and the gaming table. Here, British naval historian Rodger- -drawing on a wide range of sources, including Sandwich's own letters and papers--attempts to go beyond this caricature by viewing his subject in the context of the realities of 18th-century party politics and naval warfare. His Sandwich emerges as an ambitious man with many interests and talents but little wealth--a man who consequently was distrusted by his own class and failed to achieve full scope for his powers. His beloved wife went insane, and the mistress he subsequently took was murdered. As First Sea Lord, Sandwich began a fundamental reform of the fleet, making use of seasoned timber and the latest technique of sheathing ships' bottoms with copper to improved speed--but the American Revolution interrupted these plans. Rodger argues that Sandwich's strategy in that war made sense in terms of contemporary presuppositions and the limitations of a Britain under attack from France and Spain: The 13 colonies were lost but Quebec and the West Indies were retained and, above all, the homeland was saved from invasion. Today, Sandwich is best remembered for his part in the revival and continued popularity of Handel's music--and for sandwiches. A pleasure to read--and offering new depth and insights into the political and social values of a critical epoch. (Illustrations) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this meticulously researched scholarly biography, Rodger ( The Wooden World: An Anatomy of the Georgian Navy ) presents an interesting reassessment of the Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792). Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty from 1748-1751 and again from 1771-1782, Sandwich was unfairly maligned as an inept administrator who was responsible for Britain's naval defeats during the American Revolution, according to Rodger. He argues that Sandwich deserves credit for naval reform and for saving Canada, India and the West Indies as British colonies. The author also discounts Sandwich's reputation as immoral and as a gambler. Devoted to his wife until she became mentally ill, Sandwich then lived with his mistress, a singer, for 17 years until she was murdered by a crazed admirer. Lacking a family fortune, Sandwich was beset by financial worries, but gambled no more than any other 18th-century lord. We also learn that the action for which he is best known--putting meat between two pieces of bread--was likely to have taken place at his desk, not at the gaming table.

Here are recipes for all the elements of a full-course Nepali meal. Special cooking methods and ingredients are fully explained.Unless in 1986 you discovered Nepali Delights, the first edition of this book, it's unlikely that you have a Nepali cookbook in your collection. This compendium of family recipes from more than 50 contributors provides a sampling of the favorite dishes that make up this cuisine, influenced by both Tibetan and, more familiar to American readers, East Indian cooking. Grains are the base of the diet, mustard oil and ghee are used for cooking, and chiles, garlic, ginger, and cumin are favorite flavorings. It's too bad that there are very few recipe notes to give more background to the dishes, but this is a unique resource in any case.

Written by two of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on space history, <i>Hubble: Imaging Space and Time</i> illuminates the solar system&#x2019;s workings, the expansion of the universe, the birth and death of stars, the formation of planetary nebulae, the dynamics of galaxies, and the mysterious force known as "dark energy." <br><br>The potential impact of this book cannot be overstressed: The 2008 servicing mission to install new high-powered scientific instruments is especially high profile because the cancellation of the previous mission, in 2004, caused widespread controversy. The authors reveal the inside story of Hubble&#x2019;s beginnings, its controversial early days, the drama of its first servicing missions, and the creation of the dynamic images that reach into the deepest regions of visible space, close to the time when the universe began. <br><br>A wealth of astonishing images leads us to the very edge of known space, setting the stage for the new James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2013. Find the stunning panoramic of Carina Nebula, detailing star birth as never before; a jet from a black hole in one galaxy striking a neighboring galaxy; a jewel-like collection of galaxies from the early years of the universe; and a giant galaxy cannibalizing a smaller galaxy. <br><br>Timed for the 2008 shuttle launch and coinciding with the 400th anniversary of Galileo&#x2019;s first telescope, <i>Hubble: Imaging Space and Time</i> accompanies a high-profile exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum and will be featured on the popular NASM website.</p><p>David Devorkin is curator for history and astronomy and the space sciences at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. In his more than 30-year career, he has written over 90 articles and seven books. He lives in Maryland.<br><br>Robert Smith is professor of history and past chair of the Department of History and Classics at the University of Alberta, and formerly a staff member at the National Air and Space Museum. His books include the award-winning <i>The Space Telescope: A Study of NASA, Science, Technology and Politics.</i> He has closely followed Hubble&#x2019;s history for 20 years.The Hubble Space Telescope began taking spectacular photographs of the cosmos just as the Internet spread its web on Earth, granting public access to these astonishing, beautiful, and unprecedented images. So cherished were these glimpses into the universe, when NASA announced in 2004 that it would end the shuttle missions necessary to service the telescope, the protest was vehement enough to rescind the decision. This handsome volume celebrates the technological and scientific breakthroughs that have made the Hubble such a resounding success. The full, up-to-date story is told in glorious photographs and the equally sparkling commentary of Hubble experts DeVorkin and Smith. From a profile of the brilliant astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889&#x2013;1953) to detailed explanations of how the spectacular photographs of such phenomena as the Orion Nebula (its portrait required 150 orbits) were taken, the authors cover the people, science, and aesthetics of the stellar Hubble era. Not only are the telescope&#x2019;s contributions to science beyond quantification, DeVorkin and Smith aver, the images the Hubble has gathered have also had profound effects on our imagination and spiritual growth. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Quick! Turn the Page!</h2><p>Sarah is sick of winter, Eddie has nobody to play with, Lance the turtle is tired, and Herbert the mouse wants to get into another room, and readers can help them all by simply turning the page</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-- To find out what happens when Eddie has nobody to play with, or how the mouse will get past the cat, readers are told to turn the page. In most cases, a problem or question is depicted on one page, and its solution or answer on the next; case closed, and on to the next scenario. This format, featuring a string of unrelated situations, presents obstacles: the book is choppy, with no continuity; there is the demeaning implication that big-deal problems ("Sarah is sick of winter") can be zapped instantly with a flick of the wrist; and the constant repetition of the page-turning gimmick is somewhat monotonous. Surely, young readers get immediate reinforcement for operating the pages, but their page-turning is mechanical rather than motivated by interest generated from involvement. Stevenson's fans will enjoy this new dose of his characteristic cleverness and his familiar watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations, but they're the only drawing card. --Liza Bliss, Worcester Public Library, MA<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pilgrim&#39;s Regress: The Wade Annotated Edition</h2><p>Modeled after John Bunyan's famous <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, C. S. Lewis's <i>Pilgrim's Regress</i> represents a number of firsts for Lewis -- the first book he wrote after his conversion to Christianity, his first book of fiction, and the first book he published under his own name.<br><br> This splendid annotated edition, produced in collaboration with the Marion E. Wade Center in Wheaton, Illinois, helps readers recover the richness of Lewis's allegory. Often considered obscure and difficult to read, <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i> nonetheless remains a witty satire on cultural fads, a vivid account of spiritual dangers, and an illuminating tale for generations of pilgrims old and new.<br><br> Editor David C. Downing's critical introduction provides needed biographical and cultural context for fully appreciating <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i>. Downing relies throughout both on his own expertise and on previously unpublished sources from Lewis himself to identify allusions to other authors, translate quotations, and explain humor hidden within Lewis's text. Among the hundreds of annotations are references that draw parallels to Lewis's later works, including <i>Mere Christianity</i>, <i>Surprised by Joy</i>, and the Chronicles of Narnia.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) taught English literature at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities and wrote more than thirty influential scholarly and popular books. Among his many famous works are Mere Christianity,The Screw tape Letters, the Chronicles of Narniavolumes, Miracles, and Surprised by Joy.<b>Alan Jacobs</b><br> -- author of <i>The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C. S. Lewis</i><br> "Among all of C. S. Lewis's books, the one most in need of annotation is <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i>, which fairly bristles with allusions to writers and ideas, some ancient, some recent, some famous, some obscure. It takes a learned and discerning scholar to tease out all these references. Fortunately, David Downing is just such a scholar, and this book is an outstanding contribution to Lewis studies."<br><br><b>Peter Schakel</b><br> -- author of <i>The Way into Narnia: A Reader's Guide</i><br> "Downing's consistently thorough and well-informed annotations do a superb job of clarifying and enlivening this difficult, but very important, early work by C. S. Lewis. All readers of Lewis will be grateful."<br><br><b>Devin Brown</b><br> -- author of <i>A Life Observed: A Spiritual Biography of C. S. Lewis</i><br> "<i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i>, the first book Lewis wrote after becoming a Christian, remains one of the best records of how he went from cynical atheist to joyous believer. It is no exaggeration to say that David Downing's superb annotations allow those of us who do not share Lewis's vast philosophical, literary, and linguistic background to understand and enjoy this classic work in a way not possible before. A must for all serious Lewis fans."<br><br><b>Colin Duriez</b><br> -- author of <i>The A-Z of C. S. Lewis</i><br> "C. S. Lewis spoke of the 'needless obscurity' of this early fiction of ideas. Later he added notes and an explanatory preface for the reader of seventy years ago. Now David C. Downing has gone further and helped to make Lewis's engaging and classic modern pilgrim's quest even more accessible for today's reader. I've reread <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i> more often than many of Lewis's writings and am delighted at this new edition."<br><br><i><b>Catholic Library World</b></i><br> &#x201c;This annotated edition will be welcomed by all those who enjoy Lewis&#x2019;s other books and want to understand this one. . . . Downing provides definitions for obscure terms and writers alluded to in the text, translations of and information about foreign phrases, and many other useful notes that elucidate otherwise baffling passages and make the book far more comprehensible and enjoyable. . . .

It brims with insights into the intellectual world of the 1920s and early 30s that still ring true. Most important for Lewis fans, Downing&#x2019;s annotations guide the reader through his thicket of ideas and point out the themes in the narrative. . . .

Thomas Moore</h2><p>Dark Nights of the Soul</p><p>When it comes to spiritual growth, we humans are solar-seeking beings; eager for the bright lights of clarity and the bliss of illumination. Paradoxically, we all need to walk through the shadow of the dark night in order to discover a life worth living, according to psychotherapist and spiritual commentator Thomas Moore. Unlike depression, which is more of an emotional state, Moore calls the dark night a slow transformation process, which is fueled by a profound period of doubt, disorientation and questioning. Ultimately, a journey into the dark night will reshape the very meaning of your life. As a self-proclaimed "lunar type," Moore is comfortable leading his clients and readers into the shadows, where ambiguities and mysteries lurk around every corner. He describes the dark night journey in stages, starting with feeling distant from your life even as you continue to go through the motions. The second phase is "liminality," meaning living on the threshold between the known self and the unknown self. This is perhaps the most uncomfortable phase as the dark night may "take you away from the cultivation and persona you have developed in your education and from family learning," he explains. After dwelling in this murky darkness, there's a stage of "re-incorporation," in which one integrates the profound inner transitions into daily life. Like a tour guide to the underworld, Moore leads readers through all these phases, offering tools and rituals for making the journey more tolerable or at least more meaningful. He also speaks to the many arenas and stages of life in which we might find ourselves stumbling through the dark, with chapters on marriage, parenting, sexuality, creativity and health. The scope is ambitious, and at times the structure seems disjointed&#x2014;but this is perhaps Moore&#x2019;s best contribution since <i>Care of the Soul</i>, proving once again that he is a wise and formidable spiritual teacher. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Thomas Moore is the author of the phenomenal bestseller Care of the Soul. He lived as a Catholic monk for twelve years and later became a psychotherapist, with degrees in theology, musicology and religion.</p><h2>D&#39;Aulaires&#39; Book of Greek Myths</h2><p>"For any child fortunate enough to have this&nbsp;&nbsp;generous book...the kings and heroes of ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;legend will remain forever matter-of-fact; the&nbsp;&nbsp;pictures interpret the text literally and are full of&nbsp;&nbsp;detail and witty observation."--<i>Horn&nbsp;&nbsp;Book</i>. <br><br>"The drawings...are excellent&nbsp;&nbsp;and excitingly evocative."--<i>The New&nbsp;&nbsp;York Times</i>.</p><p>No education is complete without a large slice of Greek mythology. And there's no better way of meeting that literary quota than with the D'Aulaires' book. All the great gods and goddesses of ancient Greece are depicted in this big, beautiful classic, lovingly illustrated and skillfully told. Young readers will be dazzled by mighty Zeus, lord of the universe; stirred by elegant Athena, goddess of wisdom; intimidated by powerful Hera, queen of Olympus; and chilled by moody Poseidon, ruler of the sea. These often impetuous immortals flounce and frolic, get indiscreet, and get even. From petty squabbles to heroic deeds, their actions cover the range of godly--and mortal--personalities.<p> The D'Aulaires' illustrations have a memorable quality: once pored over, they will never leave the minds of the viewer. Decades later, the name Gaea will still evoke the soft green picture of lovely Mother Earth, her body hills and valleys and her eyes blue lakes reflecting the stars of her husband, Uranus the sky. No child is too young to appreciate the myths that have built the foundation for much of the world's art and literature over the centuries. This introduction to mythology is a treasure.

Shortly after their marriage, they moved to the United States and began to create the picture books that established their reputation as two of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most important children&#x2019;s writers and illustrators. They won the 1940 Caldecott Medal for <i>Abraham Lincoln. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> During an extended trip to Greece, they studied and sketched the countryside, the people, and the architecture and artifacts of long ago.

Mittleider was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. After completing formal schooling there, he moved to California and concentrated on a scientific and practical study of agriculture, which he mastered. <p>His primary interest was raising beautiful flowers and shrubbery, and the result was the founding in Loma Linda, California, of Mitts Nursery, Inc., in 1947. For 15 years his products sold widely and graced the homes and flower gardens of thousands of people from California to Maine. </p><p>He invented nine new varieties of carnations, which carry such intriguing names as Moon Moth, Firelight, and April Dawn. Franchise arrangements also produced these in Europe and South Africa. </p><p>To speed delivery of his plants, he developed Magic Mitts, a new method of growing, packaging, and delivering plants and flowers through a nation-wide retail chain. </p><p>During these years he conquered weeds, harmful insects, and plant diseases and perfected a technique for making soil produce near-perfect plants and flowers in budget-balancing abundance. </p><p>In 1964, he closed his successful nursery business and decided to live on his modest annuity so he could devote his remaining years to serving mankind in the field of scientific food production. He was an instructor in the Extension Faculty of Loma Linda University and has been an International Agricultural Consultant and given extensive instruction and successful vegetable-gardening demonstrations in many locations throughout the U. S. A. and Canada, as well as New Guinea, Fiji, Okinawa, the Philippines, Trinidad (West Indies), Mexico, Honduras, Guyana, and Africa. From 1989 to 1996 he conducted season-long gardening courses in Russia, helping those people increase their food crops from 4 (cabbage, potatoes, beets, and carrots) to 23.

Peterson, the company's original marketing director, was booted out in 1992, just as the firm topped $500 million in sales. WordPerfect--the 80's most wildly successful word-processing product--began in 1977 as an idle summer project by an underemployed Brigham Young computer-science instructor named Alan Ashton. When the program miraculously worked on the mainframe computers that were then the norm, he hired Bruce Bastion (the author's brother-in-law and a college band leader) to help sell it, and the author (then part-owner of a failing drapery store) to be business manager and marketing guru at $5.00 an hour. A few years later, Ashton and Bastion appeared on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people and--in spite of predictable but fascinating fumbles and glitches--sales were soaring and the company couldn't hire programmers and support personnel quickly enough. But in addition to a fast-flowing stream of new PC- compatible WordPerfect products, the company launched a series of secondary products with names like P-Edit, MathPlan, SSI*Data, SSI*Forth, and InForms--all of which failed. Meanwhile, Peterson- -desperately trying to promote all the new software while maintaining a semblance of order in a corporation now 600-strong and full of turf wars and chaos--became something of a tyrant. In the final battle--fought over distribution strategy for WordPerfect 5.0--he lost and was abruptly out: ``There was dancing in the aisles of some departments.'' Nevertheless, he shares his painfully acquired management philosophy in an afterword. A well-written and often hair-raising tale of serendipitous software success, given a special timeliness by the comparable corporate shake-out at Apple, including the firing of longtime chief John Sculley. (First printing of 25,000) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Computer entrepreneurs such as Steven Jobs and Bill Gates are fairly well known. On the other hand, even though their company controlled almost 50 percent of the word-processing software market at one point, the "regular guys" who built the WordPerfect Corporation are relatively anonymous. That, in fact, may have been Peterson's problem. Part of the three-man team that ran WordPerfect for nearly a dozen years, Peterson owned 1 percent of the company (each of his two partners owned 49.5 percent) and was responsible for marketing and sales. As Gates' Microsoft surpassed WordPerfect's market share, Peterson's partners took drastic steps to turn the company around. They forced Peterson out and replaced him with an executive committee of seven, including, for the first time, a chief financial officer. With the introduction of WordPerfect for Windows, the company has been regaining customers. More hurt than bitter, Peterson tells his version of WordPerfect's story.

Much of the five-month campaign was waged on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island. Despite dwindling supplies and dim prospects for support, the garrison held out as long as possible and significantly delayed the Japanese timetable for conquest in the Pacific. In the end, the Japanese forced the largest capitulation in U.S. military history. The defenders were hailed as heroes and the legacy of their determined resistance marks the Philippines today.

REBECCA MARSHALL still couldn't believe she was going to be living there. She'd known for a week, but the reality of it simply hadn't sunk in. But now here she was.</p><p>Becoming a maid of honor at Queen Victoria's court was the biggest surprise she'd ever had in all of her eighteen years. Her mother, Lilly, had been hoping for this elite position to be bestowed on her daughter, but Lilly hadn't told Rebecca that she'd called in a few favors to obtain it. She hadn't wanted Rebecca to be disappointed if it didn't come to pass.</p><p>Rebecca wouldn't have been disappointed. She'd never even considered being a maid of honor at the royal court. But she knew that it was something her mother had aspired to. Lilly often spoke of her lost chance to be a maid of honor, or even a lady of the bedchamber once she'd become a married woman. Her family had been staunch Tories like her husband. And with the Whigs in power, controlling all of the court appointments, Lilly had been unable to achieve her fondest wish and had finally given it up. After all, the Whig political party had retained power for a long time.</p><p>But now the Tories, more recently called Conservatives, were finally back in office, with Sir Robert Peel as the new prime minister. Out with the old, in with the new, as it were. With new appointments being made, Lilly had quickly petitioned party officials for an appointment for Rebecca. There was no guarantee that Rebecca would receive one as there weren't many appointments to be had. But the letter had arrived ast week. And like an excitable young girl, Rebecca's mother had actually shouted for joy after reading it, she had been so thrilled. And her excitement had been contagious.</p><p>The last week had been a whirlwind. Mother and daughter had only just started planning for Rebecca's come-out in London during the next winter Season, which was still months away. They were still in the early stages of having her new wardrobe designed, with nothing created yet! So many extra seamstresses had to be hired, and decisions had to be made quickly. There were trips back and forth to the nearby town of Norford, sometimes two or three trips a day. And underlying it all was the excitement and Lilly's nonstop chatter about this being the most golden opportunity of Rebecca's life.</p><p>It was also going to be the biggest change in Rebecca's life since her father's passing. The Earl of Ryne had died when she was only eight. Lilly had never entertained the idea of remarrying. The earl's title had gone to a male relative of his, but the manor near Norford where Rebecca had grown up wasn't entailed. She'd spent her whole life there, hadn't even gone off for her schooling as had some of her closer friends. Lilly hadn't been willing to part with her, so she had arranged for Rebecca to have the best teachers right there at home.</p><p>Rebecca had loved that arrangement. It allowed her and her mother to spend a lot of time together. Both adept horsewomen, they rode nearly every day when the weather was good. Rebecca was going to miss that. With both of them having so many friends in Norford, there was always someone stopping y to visit, or some social gathering to attend. Rebecca was going to miss that, too. But they wouldn't be so far apart. Norford was only a few hours' ride north of London. However, Lilly was determined to give Rebecca some time to get settled in and used to her position, before she visited. She didn't want to appear to be an overprotective mother, even if she was!</p><p>Actually, this appointment to the queen's court would be the second golden opportunity for Rebecca that mother and daughter had extensively discussed. The first had arisen five years ago when they were in complete agreement on their first choice for Rebecca's future husband. No need for a Seasonal launch if she could catch <i>his</i> eye, and he was a neighbor, too, Raphael Locke, the Duke of Norford's heir. So convenient! But the esteemed fellow had up and married someone else before Rebecca was old enough to put herself forward, and that had ended that.</p><p>Such a shame. She had been looking forward to being a part of that interesting family. Preston Locke, the duke, had five sisters, all married and living elsewhere now, but they often returned to Norford for visits. Lilly had told stories about the days when most of those ladies had still lived at home and how the Lockes had quite dominated the local society, and in fact some of the grander parties Rebecca had attended had been at Norford Hall when she was a child. She had almost got closer to that family when she became friends with the youngest daughter of the house, Amanda Locke. It was too bad they had lost touch with each other after Amanda was sent off to private school.</p><p>The duke hadn't entertained much after that because it was only him and his elderly mother in that big house. His wife had died years ago, and while every available lady in the neighborhood had probably tried to catch his eye over the years, he remained a widower. But Ophelia Locke did the entertaining there now, the woman who had captured Raphael's heart before Rebecca could!</p><p>Two lost opportunities in that illustrious family, a best friend and a husband. But this new opportunity was upon her. A maid of honor at Queen Victoria's court! Rebecca knew all the benefits. Holding the position was comparable to attending the most elite finishing school in the world. She'd be meeting the most important people in England and royalty from across the Continent. There was no reason to wait for a Season if you were part of a court with a queen who loved to entertain. If Rebecca was lucky, the queen might even have a hand in picking her future husband. Anything was possible.</p><p>Miraculously, Rebecca's wardrobe was finished in time for her departure for London and was much grander than it would have been for a mere Season. Lilly had spared no expense. And she accompanied Rebecca and her maid, Flora, to London.</p><p>It wasn't the first time Rebecca was seeing London. There had been a few shopping excursions over the years, a horse race Lilly just had to attend since the sire of her mare was racing that day, the wedding of an old friend Lilly had been invited to, and, of course, Rebecca had joined her on all of those trips. But this was the first time she was seeing Buckingham Palace. There had been no reason to visit it before when no monarchs had made it their home until now.</p><p>Alighting from the coach with her mother and Flora, Rebeccastood there in awe of the grand structure that she wouldbe living in for months, possibly years. It was so much biggerthan she had imagined! Even the marble arch of the ceremonialentrance was stories high! Palace guards were marching nearbyin their brightly colored uniforms. Other people passed underthe huge arch that Rebecca would be walking through.</p><p>Her feet wouldn't move. Nervousness nearly overwhelmedher. She already knew Lilly wasn't going to escort her inside,but she wasn't ready to say good-bye! She'd never had to saygood-bye to her mother before, not like this.</p><p>Lilly took her hand and squeezed it. She understood. Inthat simple gesture, she gave Rebecca courage.</p><p>"Your father would have been so proud, had he lived to seethis."</p><p>Rebecca glanced at her mother. It was a poignant moment.Lilly was so happy for her daughter, and yet she was no doubtrecalling her own missed opportunities. It was in her expression,close to tears yet smiling.</p><p>"You two aren't going to cry, are you?" Flora asked in acomplaining tone.</p><p>Lilly laughed. Rebecca managed a grin. Flora was good atrelieving tension with her candor.</p><p>Unfortunately, Flora wouldn't be living in the palace withRebecca. She would only stay long enough today to get Rebeccasettled in. They both knew that Rebecca wasn't going toget a room to herself. There simply weren't enough rooms forall the members of the court, let alone for their servants. SoLilly had rented a flat for Flora nearby so she could come to thepalace each day to maintain Rebecca's wardrobe and performher usual duties.</p><p>Lilly had been entertaining the idea of buying a town housein London for Rebecca's first Season. But now that Rebecca's"Season" had begun under a completely different set of circumstances,Lilly was more hesitant about the idea. While some ofthe ladies at court owned homes in London where they spenttheir nights instead of sharing a room at the crowded palace,Lilly wanted Rebecca to experience every aspect of court, andthe surest way to do that was to live there. If the Marshalls hada town house, Rebecca might be tempted to go home to it eachnight.</p><p>Lilly gathered Rebecca into her arms for a long hug. "I'll seeyou in a few weeks, darling. At least I will <i>try</i> to stay away thatlong."</p><p>"You don't have to -- "</p><p>"Yes, I do," Lilly cut in. "This is <i>your</i> time, not mine. You'regoing to enjoy every minute of it. But you must write me everyday. I want to hear about everything."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>"But most of all, Becky, enjoy yourself. Wonderful thingsare going to happen for you. I just know it."</p><p>Rebecca really wished she had more of her mother's enthusiasm,but her own excitement had waned now that their separationwas imminent. This was her mother's dream. She wishedLilly could have had it instead of her.</p><p>But for Lilly's sake, she put on a bright smile, gave hermother one last hug, and hurried inside the palace.</p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 2009 by Johanna Lindsey</p></p><h2>The Rolex Report: An Unauthorized Reference Book For The Rolex Enthusiast</h2><p>The Rolex Report is the result of over 10 years of personal research, cram-packed with 288 pages of facts and figures with over 400 high-resolution illustrations.

At the end of the nineteenth century, anthropologists who had studied Ojibwe leadership practices developed theories about human societies and cultures derived from the perceived Ojibwe model. Scholars believed that the Ojibwes typified an anthropological &#x201c;type&#x201d; of Native society, one characterized by weak social structures and political institutions. Miller counters those assumptions by looking at the historical record and examining how leadership was distributed and enacted long before scholars arrived on the scene. Miller uses research produced by Ojibwes themselves, American and British officials, and individuals who dealt with the Ojibwes, both in official and unofficial capacities.&nbsp;By examining the hereditary position of leaders who served as civil authorities over land and resources and handled relations with outsiders, the warriors, and the respected religious leaders of the Midewiwin society, Miller provides an important new perspective on Ojibwe history.</p><p>Cary Miller is an associate professor of history at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee.

In addition, he has also written dozens of other books, including his acclaimed original novel, <i>Sir Apropos of Nothing</i>, and its sequel, <i>The Woad to Wuin.</i><p>David is also well known for his comic book work, particularly his award-winning run on <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>. He recently authored the novelizations of both the <i>Spider-Man</i> and <i>Hulk</i> motion pictures.</p><p>He lives in New York.</p><p> <b>Chapter One: Burgoyne &amp; Selar</b> </p><p> Selar stared at the desert in the middle of Burgoyne's living room, then looked in astonishment at the Hermat. She held their child close to her, looked as if she wanted to say something, said nothing, and instead looked back at the desert. </p><p> "Too much?" inquired Burgoyne solicitously. </p><p> Cautiously Selar walked the perimeter of the red desert sands. She felt heat radiating from the sands. A heat lamp above gave a fair approximation of a desert sun. "This," she said slowly, "is insane." </p><p> Burgoyne looked rather surprised. "I don't know why you would say that." </p><p> "Why I would say that?" The Vulcan doctor had walked around the desert and wound up back next to Burgoyne. The infant, Xyon, cooed blissfully. "Burgoyne...there is a desert...in the living room. Why is there a desert in the living room?" </p><p> "Not enough space in the den." </p><p> "That is not the point," Selar said with forced patience. </p><p> "Yes, I suspected it wasn't," Burgoyne admitted. "You don't like it?" </p><p> "That is also not the point. It has nothing to do with like or dislike. The question is why you felt a need to construct a replica of a desert in a room normally reserved for matters of socialization." </p><p> "For you." </p><p> "I do not recall asking you to construct such a thing." </p><p> "Yes, I know you didn't ask. I was doing it to try to make you feel at home." </p><p> Selar let out a long, patient, and -- ultimately -- emotionless sigh. "Burgoyne," she said finally, "we need to talk." </p><p> "All right," Burgoyne said reasonably. S/he went to a chest of drawers and pulled out a couple of large blankets. This action puzzled Selar somewhat, but things were quickly made clear when Burgoyne spread the blankets out on the sand and dropped down onto one of them. S/he patted the other one, indicating that Selar should take a seat next to hir. Selar was sorely tempted to remain standing, but decided that matters would be simpler if she just humored the Hermat for a while. So she sat on the blanket that was a few inches away from Burgoyne. </p><p> Burgoyne looked quite ready to listen to anything that Selar was prepared to say. "Go ahead," s/he prompted. </p><p> "Burgoyne," she said slowly, "first, I should acknowledge the efforts to which you have gone. Obviously, you are aware that my native Vulcan is somewhat arid and desert-like in many places. Unlike the other Starfleet personnel who are taking advantage of the cooling-off period, you have chosen not to reside in San Francisco, in proximity to the Academy. Instead, you have obtained this lovely residence here in Nevada, on a stretch of territory that is not unlike Vulcan." </p><p> "I wanted to make you comfortable." </p><p> "I know. Your attention to my comfort and to any desires that I either might have, or that you <i>think</i> I might have, has been very..." She cast about in her mind for the right word. "Flattering," she finally settled on. "And I have been willing to accommodate your endeavors because...frankly, I had not developed a workable strategy to the contrary. However -- " </p><p> "However what?" s/he prompted. "You can tell me anything, Selar. You know that." </p><p> "No. I do not know that," Selar replied. "There are many things that I cannot tell you because it is a waste of time. There are things that you do not wish to hear, and, therefore, you tend not to hear them." </p><p> "What sort of things? I'm listening now." </p><p> "Burgoyne..." She drew a deep breath. "I do not love you." </p><p> "Yes, you do," Burgoyne said cheerily. </p><p> Selar let the breath out, shaking her head. "You see?" </p><p> "Yes, I do see. I see that you're afraid -- " </p><p> "No. I am not afraid." She rose and walked around the interior desert, shaking her head in a combination of frustration and amusement. "I am Vulcan. I am logical. I am able to put the reasonable aspects of a relationship ahead of any foolish emotional entanglements. And, logically, it is utterly unreasonable to think that any long-term relationship between us could work." </p><p> "Excuse me, Selar," Burgoyne said, indicating the child who was happily burbling on the blanket, "but we already have a long term commitment, and that's him. He's as much my child as he is yours." </p><p> Selar was silent. </p><p> "I said, 'He's as much -- '" </p><p> "I heard you, Burgoyne," she said softly. "My hearing is quite acute, as I am sure you are aware." </p><p> Burgoyne leaned back against the nearest wall, watching Selar with open confusion. "Are you disagreeing?" s/he asked. There was something in hir tone that seemed vaguely warning. </p><p> "The child has Vulcan ears, and the face is of a generally Vulcan cast. As for his reproductive system..." </p><p> "He is singularly male. Yes, I know." </p><p> She raised an eyebrow. "You say that with a hint of regret." </p><p> Burgoyne's lips thinned. "You keep talking about how you know nothing about emotions, Selar. About how above them you are. So, if it's all the same to you, don't start attributing emotions to how I say things, considering you claim to be unfamiliar with them." </p><p> "Very well," she said. "The point is...your genetic contribution seems minimal to nonexistent." </p><p> "I'm still his father." </p><p> "And for that, you will always have my gratitude. But -- " </p><p> "Gratitude," Burgoyne interrupted her, snorting disdainfully. "You know, Selar, I'm starting to wonder if you know the meaning of the word." </p><p> "Gratitude. Noun. An appreciative awareness or -- " </p><p> "That's not what I mean and you know it!" It seemed as if Burgoyne's meticulously crafted control was starting to erode. Selar couldn't help but think that if Burgoyne was in some sort of "competition" to see who could keep themselves reserved longer, s/he didn't have a prayer. S/he was pacing furiously. </p><p> Still sitting on the floor, Xyon's attention was now caught by hir, and he watched hir as s/he moved back and forth. </p><p> "How much more do I have to be there for you? I was there for you when you were in the grip of <i>pon farr.</i> I was there for you, for emotional support, during your pregnancy. I saved your life -- " </p><p> "Burgoyne, I know that -- " </p><p> <i>"Saved your life!"</i> s/he shouted over her. "I was so linked into your mind that I fought monsters and kept you alive so that you could give birth to our son in a hostile environment -- " </p><p> "Technically, it was a single monster, not plural." </p><p> <i>"Who cares?"</i> </p><p> "I care. We might as well be precise." </p><p> Burgoyne covered hir face with hir hands. "Selar...does it matter whether it was one monster, two, or twenty? The point is, you owe me your life, and the life of Xyon." </p><p> "I am very well aware of that," Selar said reasonably. "But what did you expect of me, Burgoyne? Did you believe that I would come to love you because of those things?" </p><p> "I believed that, at the very least, you wouldn't reject me out of hand." </p><p> "It is not out of hand. It is..." </p><p> "What? What is it?" </p><p> Selar looked away. "Burgoyne...you want me to give something of which I am not capable." </p><p> "I don't believe that," Burgoyne said firmly. "I don't believe that you're incapable of love. Incapable of acknowledging that you are capable, perhaps, but that's as far as I'll take it." S/he shook hir head in exasperation. "You know what? I'm starting to wonder why I even bother." </p><p> "As am I," Selar said reasonably. "What did you think was going to happen here, Burgoyne?" She steadied herself. "It is my fault. You see, Burgoyne...I was operating out of gratitude. Believe it or not," she added dryly. </p><p> "Let's just say I'm skeptical," Burgoyne said, but s/he sounded uncertain. </p><p> "I agreed to come out here, to reside with you in this domicile, because I believed that you were...entitled in some way. That, after everything you had been through in connection with me and this child -- " </p><p> "Xyon." </p><p> "Yes. Xyon." She frowned. "I know his name." </p><p> "That may be, but you never say it. You just say, 'this child.' You should refer to him by his name.

In this helpful book, Robert Reid argues that pastors will be more faithful and effective in their preaching when they understand exactly what they are trying to accomplish when they enter the pulpit. Do they want to encourage? Offer wisdom? Persuade folks to take up a particular course of action? Prophetically criticize the church or society? Reid contends that preachers tend to generally adopt one of four possible &#34;voices&#34; for their preaching: teaching, encouraging, sage, or testifying. He shows how these four voices differ, helps pastors understand which voice is predominantly theirs, and helps them sharpen the appropriate preaching skills. Sample sermons of each type of voice are included.</p><p>Robert Stephen Reid (Ph.D., University of Washington) is director of the masters of arts in communications program and chair of the communications department at the University of Dubuque in Dubuque, Iowa.

She teaches at the University of Maryland. Her novel The Last Summer of the World was published in 2007. She lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.*Starred Review* Photographer Edward Steichen, cosmopolitan and controversial, is an excellent subject for historical fiction. But debut novelist Mitchell chose not to reimagine Steichen's glamorous career as a portrait and fashion photographer. Rather, she zeroes in on Steichen's life-altering service during World War I. Responsible for aerial reconnaissance, Steichen and his men are in the line of fire as they fly over German troops, and Mitchell vividly imagines the terror of these historic dogfights. Her Steichen is also fighting a private ground war with his wife, Clara, as she seeks revenge for Steichen's alleged affair with her former best friend. Mitchell uses Steichen's moody art photographs as stepping-stones between scenes of military suspense and tragedy and the heartbreak of a disastrous marriage. Forced to sacrifice her musical career to fulfill her duties as mother and wife to an artist more ruthless in his devotion to his work than she, Clara is a profoundly poignant figure. And Steichen is no villain. Enriching her intensely psychological tale with cameos of Auguste Rodin and others. Mitchell evokes the spell of creativity and the pain of rupture when following one's vision severely complicates relationships. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The wind is blowing down trees. Awful Ogre's rattlesnake wakes him. He tickles his piranha, scatters his rats, and disengages his leeches. Another wonderful day is about to begin.</p><p>Awful Ogre, huge, hungry, horrible--and totally lovable, will steal the heart of every reader. Larger than life--larger, in fact, than all other ogres, Awful Ogre packs into one day enough excitement, imagination, emotion, and sheer ebullience to last most of us a lifetime </p><p>Jack Prelutsky and Paul O. Zelinsky have created a tour de force of epic proportions and infinite appeal.</p></p><p>How awful is this green-haired, one-eyed ogre? So awful his name is Awful Ogre. Fortunately, he takes some time out of his awfully busy ogre schedule to describe his routine, poem by poem, from the moment his pet rattlesnake awakens him to a touching bedtime scene--as rhythmic and tender as <i>Goodnight Moon</i>, but with scorpions and cacti. As it turns out, the ogre has many delightful hobbies, from dancing ("I dance with abandon, / Bravura, and zest, / I carom off boulders / And beat on my chest") to singing "stirring ogre melodies" to bone collecting to boasting to watching TV. He is particularly proud of his centuries-old garden: <blockquote> Because of my ramshackle patches<br> Where scrofulous weeds rule unchecked,<br> I've earned from the trolls and the goblins<br> A measure of grudging respect.<br> </blockquote> Jack Prelutsky, creator of more than 30 books of verse, is clearly in his element here, though he claims that "Any resemblance between Awful Ogre and the poet is purely coincidental." And, Paul O. Zelinsky, who received the 1998 Caldecott Medal for <i>Rapunzel</i> explodes into zany genius in this gruesomely gorgeous picture book, perfect for any 8-year-old boy in the peak of his giddy gross-out phase. We could spend hours scouring the pages for tiny details, lovingly etched by Zelinsky, from a tiny protesting man in a fish food container next to a piranha to the artful steam above the ogre's bowl of scream of wheat. This book is a masterpiece. He may smell of weasel grease, drink gargoyle bile, eat scrambled legs, and grow carnivorous roses, but Awful Ogre is a friend your kids won't mind having.

But with each change of season comes a change in conviction: "I think autumn is my favorite season. . . . With the light on the water and the marsh turning golden." The muted palette of Sabuda's ( Saint Valentine ; I Hear America Singing ) pastels echoes the thoughtful, quiet nature of the text. But, more importantly, they impart an extra dimension to the feathered characters of this sparely told story, adding dramatic tension. Evoking a quiet, still appreciation for nature, this book may quell the day's bustle and provide a gentle segue into sleep. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 2-An ibis and an egret muse about the cycle of seasons as it affects the inhabitants and the environs in their marsh home.

"'...you and I, Ibis, can see more than others. So be still, dear Ibis, be quiet and still.'" Pastels in dark, earthy shades picture the transformations thoroughout the marshland, capturing the essense of natural beauty undisturbed by humankind and pollution.

Ultimately this book is a testament to the human spirit, a tale of hope. Its stories of tragedy, abuse, trust, and dreams betrayed are more than offset by Wariner&#x2019;s pure goodness: her courage, determination, wits, resilience, and ultimately, in her quest to save her beloved siblings, triumph.

But while Pompeii was covered by a relatively shallow layer of loose volcanic ash, Herculaneum was submerged in deep flows of hot volcanic mud, which preserved the upper stories of buildings, as well as organic materials like wooden furnishings and foodstuffs.<br> <br>This oversized volume opens with an account of the city's catastrophic destruction in AD 79, and of the excavations, underway since 1738, that have brought at least a part of its treasures back to light.

Elsewhere, time has gradually chipped away at ancient structures or, in other cases, transformed them, absorbed them, and changed their function, at times swallowing them entirely and canceling the least scrap of evidence. In contrast, the Vesuvian excavation, particularly at Herculaneum, have revealed the scene of a catastrophe, that has just occurred in a city that was, until that moment, teeming with life: houses are left roofless, walls toppled over, doors knocked off their hinges, and furniture strewn every which way, but almost everything can be salvaged or reconstructed. At Herculaneum, the high temperature associated with the volcanic phenomenon also created conditions of preservation that are almost without comparison, even at Pompeii, yielding in carbonized form, the entire range of organic materials: food, papyri textiles, rope, wax, tablets, and the wooden elements of furniture and buildings, all the valuable sources of information about these "minor"<br>aspects of civilization. <br></p><h2>Read or Die, Vol. 4</h2><p>Yomiko Readman&#39;s love for literature goes far beyond any run-of-the-mill bookworm&#39;s!

Michael is a native New Yorker whose first entrepreneurial venture was the creation of a sports memorabilia company called Waxman. Over a ten-year period, Michael built Waxman into New York's top provider of sports collector's items. After taking a broker-friend's bad advice and losing his life savings, he developed an interest in the financial markets, and spent his spare time researching market trends and developing his own theories on market behavior. Determined to earn back his losses and vowing to never use a broker again, Michael began trading for himself, with the moniker "Waxie." Making use of the skills and instincts he cultivated through years of careful research, Michael turned $33,000 into more than seven million dollars in less than three years. Michael is regularly consulted for investment advice by major media including The Wall Street Journal, CNNfn, CNBC, New York Post, FOX News, Financial Times, Business Talk Radio and Crain's New York Business.

It is a complete guide to where trout live and feed. Chapters on currents, rocks, pools, riffles and runs, and sections on seasonal changes, approaches and differences between stream size and trout species. Graced with dozens of drawings and more than 75 photos, this book will give all trout catchers a more coherent understanding of the waters they fish.</p><p>$11.95. sports To "read" a trout stream is to deduce from its visible clues what is happening beneath the surfacespecifically, where fish are likely to be and how they are likely to be oriented. Rosenbauer has produced close to the definitive work on a topic usually left to the experience of the fisherman, aided by articles or chapters in general fishing treatises. Recommended for large fishing collections, but not essential for smaller libraries. David J.

Entries are arranged alphabetically by artist, with each entry offering a list of New Age recordings and labels, a generally short descriptive paragraph, and specification of one or more of 16 subgenres (e.g., New Age Solo, New Age Jazz, New Age Meditation, etc.). Separate appendixes contain descriptions of these subgenres paired with artist listings and New Age record labels, addresses, and phone numbers. While descriptive entries tend to be on the thin side and much knowledge of terminology is assumed, Birosik meets her stated object of providing "a guide to facilitate the location and purchase of New Age music." Small labels and lesser-known artists are covered adequately. Price as well as usefulness will make this an attractive purchase for all types of libraries where interest warrants.<br><i>- David M.
